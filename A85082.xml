            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot long before the death of that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable perſon, your Lordſhips Mother, that great example of piety and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the Lady <hi>Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteſſe of Falkland,</hi> ſhe was pleaſed to commit to my hand that, which ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, next her Children, the deareſt pledge of her dead Lord ſome excellent Monuments of his <hi>Reaſon, Wit,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.</hi> in the ſearch of that, which he would have as gladly found, as he hath
<pb facs="tcp:165888:3"/>rationally rejected, an <hi>Infallible Iudge</hi> here on Earth in all our Controverſies in point of Religion, of which the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing world ſeemeth at preſent to ſtand in ſo much need. I have conſidered often of that ſingular truſt and friendſhip, in making me the depoſitarie of ſo rich a Jewell: And ſince ſhe, from whoſe hands I received it, is gone thither, where ſhe ſtands in no need of theſe diſcourſes, I know no perſon living that hath more right to it then your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or indeed to whom I would more willingly offer it. For though your Lordſhip be now out of my immediate charge and Tuition, yet as long as it ſhall pleaſe God to make me able to do, or point at any thing that may, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little, helpe forward to perfect a good work in you, I ſhall never account my ſelfe diſobliged. I muſt profeſſe to all the World, that there is no Family now in being, to which I owe more true ſervice, then to your Lordſhips: And ſhall to the utmoſt of my power, upon
<pb facs="tcp:165888:3"/>all occaſions make it good. I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left me but a poor thankfull heart, which hath been my onely ſure Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, when all things elſe have forſaken me: That ſtill remaines <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, being neither in the power of time nor perſons to ſpoile me of that, which like a good Conſcience to my ſelf, muſt to my friends be the beſt feaſt I can make them.</p>
            <p>My Lord, my deſign is not by this to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage your Lordſhip in this <hi>Polemicall</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, nor my ſelf neither, having neither ability nor leaſure for a buſineſs of that concern, and by reaſon of my buſie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, I had not been able to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it thus to your Lordſhip, without the aſsiſtance of Judicious Friends, that honour the work for the Authors ſake, and the Author for his owne.</p>
            <p>But, My Lord, I hope I ſhall have my end in it however, an end which no good man will envy me, namely, an occaſion hereby to reminde your Lordſhip of the Gallant Author, your Noble Father, that
<pb facs="tcp:165888:4"/>by propoſing Him to you as your conſtant Coppy, you may do Him an honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all his Friends: For while they <hi>praiſe,</hi> you may <hi>imitate</hi> him.</p>
            <p>Indeed, it is one of the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts I have in this calamitous life, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that I had the honour to be ſo: neare Him: And a reproach, which I cannot clear my ſelf of, to have been at the ſame time ſo neare, and ſo farr off; ſo neare in Converſation, and yet ſo farr removed from him in thoſe Excellencies, whereby he was the envy of this Age, and will be the wonder of the next.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Religion,</hi> (for that I ſhould begin with) was the more Eminent, becauſe the more Early, at that age, when yong Gallants think leaſt on it: When they, yong Candidates of Atheiſme begin to diſpute themſelves out of a beleefe of a <hi>Deity,</hi> urging hard againſt that, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is beſt for them that it ſhould never be, <hi>a Iudgement to come;</hi> then, I ſay, that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which theſe mention with a ſcoff or a Jeere, he began to work out with
<pb facs="tcp:165888:4"/>fear and trembling, and <hi>effectually</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that is, <hi>to honour and ſerve</hi> his Creator in the daies of his youth.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I may not forget his vaſt <hi>naturall parts: Dixit ex tempore</hi> ſaith <hi>Pliny</hi> of <hi>Iſoeus, ſed tanquam diu ſcripſerit,,</hi> and I may truely apply it to him, his Anſwers were quick and ſuddain, but ſuch, as might very well ſeem to have been meditated. In ſhort, his <hi>abilities</hi> were ſuch, as though he needed no ſupplies of <hi>induſtry,</hi> yet his <hi>induſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> ſuch as though he had had no <hi>parts</hi> at all. How often have I heard him pitty thoſe Hawking and Hunting Gentlemen, who if unſeaſonable weather for their ſports had betrayed them to keep home, without a worſe excerciſe within doores, could not have told how to have ſpent their time: And all becauſe they were ſuch ſtrangers to ſuch <hi>good Companions,</hi> with whom he was ſo familiar, ſuch as neither cloy nor weary any, with whom they converſe, ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> a perſon much eſteemed by my Lord your Father, ſo much extolls in his 31, and 35, Epiſtle of his fourth
<pb facs="tcp:165888:5"/>Book: Not friends of the Cellar, or the Kitchin; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed their <hi>owne</hi> friends rather then <hi>his</hi> who entertaineth them: But ſuch, as being bidden, are ready, uninvited intrude not, that bite no mans meat or reputation, ſilent, not ſpoken to, ſpoken to, ſpeak as we pleaſe, what we pleaſe, how long and how much we pleaſe: Candidly communicating themſelves to us without betraying our ſecrets committed to them; that ſtill tell us ſomewhat that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light us for its Antiquitie, pleaſe us for its Novelty, or ſome way or other enrich our knowledge. While others ſtudied the <hi>Heraldry</hi> of Horſes, of Doggs, or at the beſt their owne: He, though not inferior to his Neighbours in Deſcent, and Honour, knowing well how much more glorious it is to be the firſt then the laſt of a Noble Family, (Blood without Vertue making Vice but more conſpicuous) was ſo farr from relying upon that empty Title, that He ſeemed <hi>Ipſe ſuos genuiſſe Parentes,</hi> to have <hi>begotten</hi> his Anceſtors, and to have given
<pb facs="tcp:165888:5"/>them a more Illuſtrious life, then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved from them.</p>
            <p>Though there were as much true worth cloſely treaſured up in him, as well divided, had been able to have ſet up a hundred <hi>Pretenders,</hi> yet ſo much <hi>Modesty</hi> withall, that the hearing of any thing was more pleaſing to him then one tittle of his owne praiſe.</p>
            <p>This Vertue was indeed in a high degree in him, and ſhewed it ſelfe upon all occaſions. If any thing, though never ſo little unhandſomely, had been ſpoken or done where he was, he was the greateſt ſufferer in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and much more out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance then he that made the offence. And ſurely he that was ſo tender of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans <hi>Civility,</hi> may very juſtly be preſumed to have had a great regard to his owne. And ſo he had indeed. For though his <hi>Courage</hi> were as great as his <hi>Wit</hi> and his <hi>Learning,</hi> (and that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion high enough) his <hi>Valour</hi> ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted and dreadleſſe, as his great
<pb facs="tcp:165888:6"/>fall witneſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, In that fatall Haile that made more Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans then his Children: Yet to do an ill or an uncivill thing, he was an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Coward: Though he was of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Stature, of his Courage too, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and in this moſt like him, afraid of nothing but to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</p>
            <p>But what needs any body plead for his <hi>Civility</hi> more then this preſent Diſcourſe, where he excels his <hi>Antagonist</hi> in that, as well as in reaſon, and ſhewes that a <hi>Gentleman</hi> writ with a <hi>Scholars</hi> Pen.</p>
            <p>Before I ſhut up all, my Lord, one Vertue there is yet to be mentioned, which of all that ever had relation to his Lordſhip, I may not, I muſt not ever forget, and that was his <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> That is a Vertue, which by the unintermitted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of my life, I have had more then ordinary occaſion to make uſe of. And that I muſt needs ſay was it, which made all his other Graces and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies reliſh to me, He being the deareſt
<pb facs="tcp:165888:6"/>and the trueſt Friend, that through the whole courſe of my unhappy life I ever had the happineſſe to meet with.</p>
            <p>If it be a kind of pleaſure to reade diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of Friends and Friendſhip, What is it to enjoy ſuch a Friend in whom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally was, what Excellencie either Hiſtory can record, or almoſt Poëtry faine?</p>
            <p>Nothing ſo hard in <hi>Lucians Toxaris,</hi> that he durſt not do, and nothing ſo handſome in all <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Lawes of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,</hi> that he knew not how to do, and to out-do for his Friend.</p>
            <p>Let your Vertuous and dear Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, my Lord, and all your Kindred yet alive, ſpeak to this: And your bleſſed Mother were ſhe now alive, would ſay, ſhe had the beſt of Friends before the beſt of Husbands. This was it that made <hi>Tew</hi> ſo valued a Manſion to us: For as when we went from <hi>Oxford</hi> thither, we found our ſelves never out of the Univerſitie: So we thought our ſelves never abſent from our own beloved home. But I dare ſay no more of this, it being
<pb facs="tcp:165888:7"/>now a mellancholy thing, I am ſure to me, to call back into my memory happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe never to be recalled, and to afflict my ſelf anew with the conſideration of what felicity I have out-lived.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip is now the onely ſurviving pledge of that admired Father, of whom-when we his poor ſervants have ſaid all we can, the Character will be farr too ſhort. It is in you, and onely you, my Lord to ſet him out truely, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him to the life, and that will be by taking that Evangelicall Counſell, <hi>Tu autem fac ſimiliter:</hi> Do like him, live like him, and pardon me if I add one thing more, like him, Love</p>

            <head>The Preface to the READER.</head>
            <p>THe eminent abilities in the moſt noble Author of the enſuing learned Diſcourſe, and learneder Reply, can ſcarcely be imagined unknown to any whom this language can reach: But if any ſuch there be, I ſhall deſire them to learne the perfections of that moſt excellent Perſon, rather from the Dedication, then this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face;</hi> the deſigne of which, is onely to give the <hi>Reader</hi> ſome ſatisfation concerning the nature of this Controverſie in it ſelfe, and of theſe Diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in particular.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrine of their owne Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, as it is the moſt gcnerall Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and all other Churches excluded by them from their Communion: So it is of ſuch a comprehenſive nature, that being once proved and
<pb facs="tcp:165888:8"/>clearely demonſtrated, it would without queſtion draw all other Churches ſo excluded, to a moſt humble ſubmiſsion and acknowledgement, nay, to an earneſt deſire of a ſuddaine Reconciliation upon any Termes whatſoever. For howſoever they pleaſe to ſpeak and write of our Hereticall and obſtinate perſiſtance in manifeſt Errors, yet I hope they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſeriouſly thinks we would be ſo irrationall, as to contradict him whom we our ſelves think beyond a poſſibillity of erring, and to diſpute perpetually with them, whom onely to heare were to be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>But when they have propounded their Deciſions to be beleeved, and imbraced by us as Infallibly true, and that becauſe they propound them, who in their own opinion are Infallible; if notwithſtanding ſome of thoſe Deciſions ſeeme to us to be evidently falſe, becauſe cleanly contradictory to that which they themſelves propound as infallibly true, that is the Word of God: ſurely we cannot be blamed, if we have deſired their Infallibility to be moſt clearly demonſtrated, at leaſt to a higher degree of evidence then we have of the contradiction of their Deciſions to the infallible Rule. Wherefore, The great Defenders of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have with more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb facs="tcp:165888:8"/>diligence endeavoured to view the grounds of this Controverſie, and have written by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage either of their learning accurately, or of their parts moſt ſtrongly, or of the cauſe it ſelfe moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly, againſt that darling Infallibility. How clearely this Controverſie hath been managed, with what evidence of truth diſcuſſed, what ſucceſſe ſo much of reaſon hath had, cannot more plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare then in this, that the very name of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity before ſo much exalted, begins now to be very burthenſome, even to the maintainers of it: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as one of their lateſt and ableſt Proſelytes, <hi>Hugh Paulin de Creſſy,</hi> lately Dean of <hi>Lagh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, &amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Prebendary of <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in his Exomologeſis, or faithfull Narration of the occaſion and motives of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, hath dealt very clearly with the World, and told us, that this <hi>Infallibilitie is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Word.</hi> That <hi>Mr.</hi> Chillingworth <hi>hath cumbated againſt it with too too great ſucceſſe,</hi> ſo great, that <hi>he could wiſh the Word were forgotten, or at leaſt layd by.</hi> That not onely Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> whom he ſtill worthily admires; but we the reſt of the poore <hi>Proteſtants have in very deed, very much
<pb facs="tcp:165888:9"/>to ſay for our ſelves, when we are preſſed unneceſſarily with it.</hi> And therefore Mr. <hi>Creſſy's</hi> adviſe to all the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> is this, that <hi>we may never be invited to combat the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church under that notion.</hi> Oh the ſtrength of Reaſon rightly managed! O the power of Truth clearly declared! that it ſhould force an emment member of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (whoſe great Principle is non-retractation) to retract ſo neceſſary, ſo fundamentall a Doctrine, to deſert all their Schooles, and contradict all their Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſts. But indeed not without very good cauſe: For he profeſſes withall, <hi>that no ſuch word as Infallibility is to be found in any Councel: Neither did ever the Church enlarge her Authority to ſo vaſte a wideneſſe: But doth rather deliver the victory into our hands when we urge her Deciſions.</hi> In all which Confeſſions, although he may ſeeme one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſpeak of the <hi>Word,</hi> yet that cannot be it which he is ſo wearie of, becauſe we except not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the word at all, but confeſſe it rightly to ſignifie that which we impugne, neither do we ever bring any nominall Argument againſt it. But as when Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſets downe
<pb facs="tcp:165888:9"/>the Doctrine of the Church in their poſitive tearmes. <hi>Summus Pontifex, cum totam Eccleſiam docet, in his, quae ad Fidem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, nullo caſu errare poteſt.</hi> We conceive he hath ſuffciently expreſſed the ſence of the word <hi>Infallibility,</hi> ſo that, <hi>Infallibilis eſt, &amp; nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo caſu errare poteſt,</hi> are to us the ſame thing. It cannot therefore be the Word alone, but the whole importance and ſence of that word <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> ſo earneſtly deſires all his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks ever hereafter to forſake, becauſe the former Church did never acknowledge it, and the preſent Church will never be able to maintaine it. This is the great ſucceſſe which the Reaſon, Parts, and Learning of the late Defendors of our Church have had in this maine Architectonicall Controverſie.</p>
            <p>And yet though the Church never maintained it, though the Proteſtants have had ſuch advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, though Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> confeſsing both, hath wiſhed all Catholicks to forſake it, yet will he not wholly forſake it himſelf, but undertakes moſt irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally to anſwer for it. If the Church never aſſerted it, if the <hi>Catholicks be not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it,</hi> to what end will Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> the great mitigator of the rigor, and defendor of the
<pb facs="tcp:165888:10"/>latitude of the Churches Deciſions, maintaine it? If Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> have had ſuch good ſucceſſe againſt it, why will his old Friend Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> endeavour to anſwer his arguments? eſpecially, conſidering when he hath anſwered them all, he can onely from thence conclude that, Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> was a very had Diſputant, who could bring no argument able to confute that, which in it ſelfe is not to be maintained.</p>
            <p>So unreaſonable it is and inconſiſtent with his Conceſsions, that he ſhould give an anſwer at all, but the manner of his anſwer, which he gives, is farr more irrationall. For deſerting the <hi>Infallibility,</hi> he anſwers onely the authority of the Church, and ſo makes this authority anſwer for that <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> from whence theſe three manifeſt abſurdities muſt neceſſarily follow.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, When he hath anſwered all M. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>'s arguments, in the ſame manner as he pretends to anſwer them, he muſt ſtill acknowledge them unanſwerable, as they were intended by him that made them. And no argument need to be thought good for any thing elſe, if he which made it knew what he ſaid, as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> certainely <hi>did.</hi>
               </item>
               <pb facs="tcp:165888:10"/>
               <item>Secondly, He onely pretends to anſwer thoſe arguments, as againſt the authority of the Church, ſimply conſidered without relation to ſuch an <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,</hi> which were never made againſt an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſo quallified. And therefore whether the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his deare friend were to any purpoſe or no, his anſwer manifeſtly muſt be to none.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, If hee intend to refute all oppoſition made to their <hi>Infallibility</hi> by an aſſertion of their bare authority, then muſt he aſſert that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to be as great and convincing, which is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible as that which is infallible: that Guide to be as good, which may lead me out of my way, as that which cannot. That Iudge to be as fit to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any doubt, who is capable of a miſtake, as he which is not. And then I make no queſtion, but ſome of his own Church amongst the reſt of their diſlikes, will put him in mind of that handſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Cardinall <hi>Belarmine, Iniquiſsimum eſſet cogere Chriſtianos, ut non appellent ab eo Judicio, quod erroneum eſſe potuit.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I once thought to have replied to thoſe anſwers, which he hath given to Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments: but his antecedent Conceſsion hath made them ſo inconſiderable to me, that upon a
<pb facs="tcp:165888:11"/>ſecond thought, I feare I ſhould be as guilty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying after my Objections, as he hath been in anſwering after his Confeſsions. Wherefore I ſhall conclude with an aſſeveration of min own, which ſhall be therefore ſhort becauſe mine: That the Reply of this moſt excellent Perſon, <hi>Sola operarum ſumma praeſertim in Graecis incuria excepta,</hi> is the moſt accurate Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, which can be ſaid in this Controverſie, that ever yet appeared, and if what hath already been delivered have had ſuch ſucceſſe upon ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent an adverſary, then may we very rationally expect at leaſt the ſame effect upon all, who ſhall be ſo happy as to read theſe Diſcourſes.</p>

            <head>OF THE INFALLIBILITY OF THE CHURCH OF ROME. A diſcourſe written by the Lord Viſcount <hi>FALKLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O him that doubteth whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath any errors, they anſwer, that ſhe hath none, for ſhe never can have any; this being ſo much harder to beleeve then the firſt, had need be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſome certainer Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, if they expect that the beleefe of this one
<pb facs="tcp:165888:12"/>ſhould draw on whatſoever they pleaſe to propoſe; yet this, if offered to be proved by no better wayes, then we offer to prove by, that ſhe hath erred; which are arguments from Scripture, and ancient Writers, all which they ſay are fallible, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is not ſo but the Church: Which if it be the onely infallible determination, and that can never be believed upon its owne authority, we can never infallibly know that the Church is infallible, for theſe other waies of proofe may deceive both them and us, and ſo neither ſide is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them; If they ſay that an argument out of Scripture is ſufficient ground of Divine Faith, why are they offended with the Proteſtants for belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving every part of their Religion upon that ground, upon which they build all theirs at once. And if following the ſame Rule, with equall deſire of finding the Truth by it, (having neither of thoſe qualities which <hi>Iſid. Pelus,</hi> ſaith are the cauſe of all Hereſie, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Pride and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judication) why ſhould God be more offended with the one, then with the other, though they chance to erre.</p>
            <p>They ſay, the Church is therefore made infallible by God, that all men may have ſome certain Guide; yet, though it be infallible, unleſſe it both plainly appeare to be ſo, (for it is not certaine to whom it doth not appeare certaine) and unleſſe it be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt which is the Church, God hath not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his end; and it were to ſet a ladder to Heaven, and ſeem to have a great care of my going up, whereas unleſſe there be care taken that I may
<pb facs="tcp:165888:12"/>know this ladder is here to that purpoſe, it were as good for me it never had been ſet.</p>
            <p>If they ſay we may know, for that generall Tradition inſtructs us in it.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that ignorant people cannot know this, and ſo it can be no Rule for them; and if learned people miſtake in this, there can be no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them.</p>
            <p>For ſuppoſe, to know whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may erre, (as a way which will conclude againſt her, but not for her) I ſeek whether ſhe have erred; and conceiving ſhe hath contradicted her ſelf, conclude neceſſarily ſhe hath erred, I ſuppoſe it not damnable, (though falſe) becauſe I try the Church by one of the touch-ſtones which herſelf appoints me (Conformity with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.) For to ſay, I am to beleeve the preſent Church, that it differs not from the former, though it ſeem to me to do ſo, is to ſend me to a witneſſe, and bid me not beleeve it; now to ſay the Church is provided for a guide of Faith, but muſt be known by ſuch markes as the ignorant cannot ſeek it by, and the learned may chance not find it by, can no way ſatisfie me.</p>
            <p>If they ſay God will reveale the Truth to whomſoever ſeeks it theſe waies ſincerely, this ſaying both ſides will (without meanes of being confuted) make uſe of, therefore it would be as good that neither did.</p>
            <p>When they have proved the Church to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible yet to my underſtanding they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded nothing farther, unleſſe we can be ſure
<pb facs="tcp:165888:13"/>which is it. For it ſignifies onely that God will have a Church alwaies which ſhall not erre, but not that ſuch, or ſuch a ſucceſſion ſhall be in the right, ſo that if they ſay, the <hi>Greek</hi> Church. is not the Church, becauſe by its own confeſſion it is not Infallible: I anſwer, That it may be now the Church, and may hereafter erre, (and ſo not be now infallible) and yet the Church never erre, becauſe before their fall from Truth, others may ariſe to maintaine it, who then will be the Church, and ſo the Church may ſtill be infallible, though not in reſpect of any ſet perſons, whom we may know at all times for our Guide.</p>
            <p>Then if they prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the true Church, and not the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their opinions are conſonant either to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture or Antiquitie, they run into a Circle, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Tenets to be true. Firſt, becauſe the Church holds them: And then theirs to be the Church, becauſe the Church holds the Truth: Which laſt, though it appears to me the onely way, yet it takes away its being a Guide, which we may follow without examination, without which all they ſay beſides, is nothing.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſuppoſe that they had evinced, that ſome ſucceſſion were Infallible, and ſo had proved to a learned man, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Chruch muſt be this, becauſe none elſe pretends to it, yet this can be no ſufficient ground to the ignorant, who cannot have any infallible foundation for their beleefe, that the Church of <hi>Greece</hi> pretends not to the ſame; and even to the Learned it is but an accidentall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<pb facs="tcp:165888:13"/>becauſe if any other Company had likewiſe claimed to be Infallible, it had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown all.</p>
            <p>The chiefeſt reaſon why they diſallow of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for Judge, is, becauſe when differences ariſe about the interpretation, there is no way to end them: And that it will not ſtand with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, to damne men for not following Ins Will, if he had aſſigncd no infallible way to find it.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe this to be wonderfull true, (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) and let them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves that think otherwiſe; yet this will be no Argument againſt him that beleeves, that to them who follow their reaſon in the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Scriptures, God will either give his Grace for aſſiſtance to find the Truth, or his pardon if they miſſe it: And then this ſuppoſed neceſſitie of an infallible Guide, (with the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed damnation for want of it) fall together to the ground.</p>
            <p>If they command us to beleeve infallibly the contrary to this, they are to prove it falſe by ſome infallible way (for the concluſion muſt be of the ſame nature, and not conclude more then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes ſet down.) Now ſuch a way Scripture, and Reaſon, and infuſed Faith cannot be, (for they uſe to object the fallibility of theſe, to thoſe that build their Religion upon them) nor the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, (for this is part of the Queſtion, and muſt it ſelf be firſt proved, and that by none of the former waies, for the former reaſons.)</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:165888:14"/>
            <p>The Popes Infallibility can be no infallible ground of Faith, being it ſelf no neceſſary part of Faith, and we can be no ſurer of any thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then we are of that which proves it:) and if he be fallible, no part is the more infallible for his ſiding with them; So if the Church be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I have no way to know the true Church, but by ſearching which agrees with Scripture and Antiquitie, and ſo judging accordingly: (but this is not to ſubmit my ſelf to her opinions, as my Guide, which they tell us is neceſſarie) which courſe, if they approve not of as fit for a learned, man, they are in a worſe caſe for the ignorant, who can take no courſe at all, nor is he the better at all for his Guide the Church, whilft two parts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute which is it, and that by arguments he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not.</p>
            <p>If I grant the Pope, or a Councell by him cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to be infallible, yet I conceive their decrees can he no ſufficient grounds, (by their own axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms) of divine Faith.</p>
            <p>For firſt of all, no Councell is valid, not approved by the Pope (for thus they overthrow that held at <hi>Ariminum</hi>) and a Pope choſen by <hi>Simony,</hi> is <hi>(ipſo facto)</hi> no Pope.</p>
            <p>I can have then no certainer grounds for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of thoſe decrees, and conſequently for my beleefe of them, then I have, that the choice of him is neither directly, nor indirectly <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe him Pope, and to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed their decrees; yet, that theſe are the decrees
<pb facs="tcp:165888:14"/>of a Councell, or that he hath confirmed them, I can have'but an uncontradicted confeſſion of many men; (for if another Councell ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare theſe to have been the Acts of another for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Councell, I ſhould need againe ſome certain way of knowing how this declaration is a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell) which is no ground, ſay they, of Faith, I am ſure not ſo good and generall a one, as we have that the Scripture is Scripture, which yet they will not allow any to be certaine of, but from them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For the ſence of their decrees, I can have no better expounder then reaſon; which if (though I miſtake) I ſhall not be damned for following, why ſhall I for miſtaking the ſence of the Scripture? or why am I a leſſe fit Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of the one, then of the other? and when both ſeeme equally cleare, and yet contradictory, ſhall not I aſſoon beleeve Scripture which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt of as great authority?</p>
            <p>But I doubt whether Councells are fit deciders of Queſtions; for ſuch they cannot be if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get more, and men are in greater doubts after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (none of the former being diminiſhed) then they were at ffrſt.</p>
            <p>Now I conceive there ariſe ſo many out of this way, that the learned cannot end all, nor the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant know all. As (beſides the fore-named conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations) who is to call them? the Pope or Kings? who are to have voices in them, Biſhops onely, or Prieſts alſo? whether the Pope, or Councell be ſuperiour: and the laſt need the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
<pb facs="tcp:165888:15"/>of the firſt (debated amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?) Whether any Countries, not being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or not being there, (as the <hi>Abiſsines,</hi> ſo great a part of Chriſtianitie, and not reſolved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned by them for Hereticks, were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi>) make it not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall? Whether if it be one not every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, (as when the Biſhops ſent from ſome places have exceeded their Commiſſion, as in the Councell of <hi>Florence</hi>) it be yet of neceſſitie to be ſubſcribed unto? Whether there were any ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reption or force uſed, and whether thoſe diſanull the Acts? Whether the moſt voices are to be held the Act of the Councell, or thoſe of all required (which never yet agreed?) Or whether two parts will ſerve, as in the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Synod? A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable doubt; becauſe <hi>Nicephorus Calliſtus,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the reſolution of a Councell at <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt that of <hi>Ariminum</hi> makes him give three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <list>
               <item>One, That the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</item>
               <item>The Second, That moſt did not agree to it.</item>
               <item>The third, That others thither gathered, were diſplcaſed at their reſolutions.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Which proves, that (in their opinions) if either moſt not preſent, agree not to it, or all preſent be not pleaſed with it, a Councell hath no power to bind.</p>
            <p>All theſe doubts I ſay perſwade me, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever brings with it ſo many new Queſtions, can be no fit end of the old.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:165888:15"/>
            <p>Then, if before a generall Councell have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined a Queſtion, it be lawfull to hold either way, and damnable to do ſo after; I deſire to know why it is ſo. Scripture and Tradition ſeem to me not to ſay ſo? but if they did ſo, I ſuppoſe you will grant they do this Doctrine, <hi>That the Soules of the bleſſed ſhall ſee God before the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> (and not be kept in ſecret Receptacles) for without this, the Doctrine of Prayers to Saints, cannot ſtand; and yet, for denying this, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> excuſeth Pope <hi>John</hi> the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> becauſe the Church (he meanes, I doubt not, a generall Councell) had not then condemned it.</p>
            <p>I deſire to know, why he ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as well without one, as many Hereticks, that are held ſo by their Church, yet condemned by none: (which if he make to be the Rule of Hereſie, it had been happy to have lived before the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> when no opinion had been dam nable, but ſome againſt the Apoſtles Councell at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> becauſe there had yet been no other generall Councell;) at leaſt, why ſhould not I be excuſed by the ſame reaſon, though I beleeve not a Councell to be infallible? ſince I never heard that any Councell hath decreed that they are ſo. neither if it hath, can we be bound by that decree, unleſſe firſt made certaine ſome other way, that it ſelfe is ſo.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, we muſt beleeve it becauſe of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I anſwer, Sometimes you will have the not beleeving any thing not declared by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, to have power enough to damne (that is when

            <p>Next, (as I have asked before) how ſhall an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant man know it? For he in likelihood can ſpeak but with a few, from whom he cannot know, that all of the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> part do now, and in paſt ages have beleeved it to be Tradition, ſo certaine as to make it a ground of Faith, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he have ſome revelation that thoſe deceived him not) neither indeed can thoſe that ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him of the opinions of former times be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely informed themſelves: For truely, if the relation of <hi>Pappias</hi> could cozen ſo far all the prime Doctors of the Chriſtian Church into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of the celebration of a thouſand yeeres after the reſurredion, ſo as that no one of thoſe two firſt ages oppoſe it, (which appeares plainly enough, becauſe thoſe that after riſe up againſt this, never quoated any thing for themſelves before <hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus,</hi> who lived at leaſt two hundred and fifty yeares after Chriſt;) nay, if thoſe firſt men did not onely beleeve it as probable, but <hi>Juſtine Martir</hi> ſaith, he holds it, and ſo do all that are in all parts Orthodox Chriſtians, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:165888:16"/>ancients as well be deceived in other points, and then what certaintie ſhall the learned have (when after much labour, they think they can make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that the ancients thought any thing Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) that indeed it was ſo, and that either the folly or the knavery of ſome <hi>Pappias</hi> deceived them not? I confeſſe it makes me think of ſome that <hi>Tully</hi> ſpeakes of, who <hi>arcem amittunt, dum propugnacula defendunt,</hi> looſe the Fort, whilſt they defend the out-works; For whilſt they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this way the Arguments of Tradition for the opinions of the <hi>Chiliaſts,</hi> they make unuſefull to themſelves the force, of Tradition, to prove any elſe by.</p>
            <p>For which cauſe it was rather wiſely then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly done of them, who (before <hi>Fevardentius</hi> ſet him forth) left out that part of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> which we alleadge, (though we need it not much; for many of the Fathers take notice of this beleef of his) yet he juſtifies himſelf for doing it, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if they leave out all errors in the books they publiſh, (that is, I ſuppoſe, all opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) <hi>bona pars ſcripto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, Patrum Orthodoxorum evaneſceret,</hi> a great part of the writings of the Orthodox Fathers muſt vaniſh away.</p>
            <p>But the Tradition that can be found out of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients (ſince their witneſſing may deceive us) hath much leſſe ſtrength, when they argue onely thus, ſure ſo many would not ſay this is true, if there were no Tradition for them,</p>
            <p>I would have you remember, they can deliver
<pb facs="tcp:165888:17"/>their opinions poſſibly, but either before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie ariſe in the Church, (upon ſome chance) or after; If before, it is confeſſed that they writ not often cautiouſly enough, and ſo they anſwer all they ſeem to ſay for <hi>Arrius,</hi> and <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Faith, before themſelves, and ſo conſequently, their controverſie (though it may be not their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) aroſe.</p>
            <p>If after, Then they anſwer often, (if any thing be by them at that time ſpoken againſt them) that the heat of diſputation brought it from them, and their reſolution to oppoſe hereticks enough; I deſire, it may be lawfull for us to anſwer ſo too, (either one of theſe former waies, or that it was (as often they ſay too) ſome Hyperbole) when they preſſe us with the opinions of Fathers.</p>
            <p>At leaſt I am ſure, if they may deceive us with ſaying a thing is Tradition, when it is not, we may be ſooner deceived if we will conclude it for a Tradition, when they ſpeak it onely as a Truth, and (for ought appeares) their particular opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Beſides, If <hi>Salvian</hi> comparing the <hi>Arrians</hi> with evill livers, (and that after they were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a Councell) extenuates (by reaſon of their beleeving themſelves in the right) with much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the fault of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and ſaith, how they ſhall be puniſhed in the day of Judgement, none can know but the Judge.</p>
            <p>If I ſay, They confeſſe it to be his opinion, they muſt alſo confeſſe the Doctrine of the Church to differ from that of <hi>Salvians</hi> time, becauſe he
<pb facs="tcp:165888:17"/>was allowed a member of that, for all this ſaying, whereas he of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſhould now ſay ſo of us, would be counted <hi>ſeſqui-heareti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> a Heretick and halfe, or elſe they muſt ſay (which they can onely ſay, and hot prove) that he was ſo earneſt againſt ill men, that for the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of their crime, he leſſened that of the Hereticks, and ſaid, what at another time he would not have ſaid; which if they do, will it not overthrow wholly the authority of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Since we can never infallibly know, what they thought at all times, from what they were moved to ſay, at ſome one time, by ſome Collatericall conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Next, To this certaine and undoubted dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all out of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which averteth me from it, comes their putting all to death that are ſo, where they have power (which is an effect, though not a neceſſary one of the firſt-opinion) and that averteth me yet more, for I do not beleeve all to be damned that they damne, but I conceive all to be killed that they kill; I am ſure if you look upon <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Epiſtle, written to perſwade concord upon their firſt diſagreement between <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Arrius,</hi> you will find, that he thought, (and if the Biſhops about him had then thought otherwiſe, he would have been ſure better informed) that neither ſide deſerved either death, or damnation, (and yet ſure you will ſay, this Queſtion was as great as ever roſe ſince) for having ſpoken of the opinions, as things ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, that the Reader might almoſt think
<pb facs="tcp:165888:18"/>that they had been fallen out at ſpurn-point, or kittle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins, he adds, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for that which is neceſſary is one thing, that all agree, and keep the ſame Faith, about divine Providence. I am ſure, in the ſame Author, <hi>Moſes</hi> (a man praiſed by him) refuſing to be made Biſhop by <hi>Lucius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and he anſwering that he did ill to refuſe it, becauſe he knew not what his Faith was, anſwered, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The baniſhing of Biſhops ſhew enough thy Faith. So that it is plaine, that he thought puniſhing for opinions to be a mark, which might ſerve to know falſe opinions by. And I beleeve throughout Antiquitie, you will find. no putting any to death, unleſſe it be ſuch as begin to kill firſt, as the <hi>Circumcellians,</hi> or ſuch like: I am ſure Chriſtian Religions chiefeſt glory being, that it encreaſeth by being perſecuted; and having that advantage of the <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> which came in by force, me thinks (eſpecially ſince <hi>Syneſius</hi> had told us, and Reaſon told men ſo before <hi>Syneſius,</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; Every thing is deſtroyed by the contrary to what ſetled and compoſed it;) It ſhould be to take ill care of Chriſtianity, to hold it up by Turkiſh meanes, at leaſt it muſt breed doubts, that if the Religion had alwaies remained the ſame, it would not be now defended by waies ſo contrary to thoſe, by which at firſt it was propagated.</p>
            <p>I deſire recrimination may not be uſed; for though it be true, that <hi>Calvin</hi> had done it, and
<pb facs="tcp:165888:18"/>the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a little (which is a little too much) for <hi>negare manifeſta non audeo, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſare immodica non poſſum,</hi> yet ſhe (confeſſing ſhe may erre) is not ſo chargeable with any fault, as thoſe which pretend they cannot, and ſo will be ſure never to mend it; and beſides I will be bound to defend no more then I have undertaken, which is to give reaſon why the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
            <p>I confeſs this opinion of damning ſo many, and this cuſtome of burning ſo many, this breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up thoſe, who knew nothing elſe in any point of Religion, yet to be in a readineſſe to cry, <hi>To the fire with him, to Hell with him,</hi> (as <hi>polybius</hi> ſaith in a certaine furious faction of an army of ſeverall nations, and conſequently of ſeverall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> They all joyned onely in underſtanding this word, <hi>[throw at him.]</hi> Theſe I ſay, in my opinion were chiefly the cauſes which made ſo many, ſo ſuddenly leave the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that indeed to borrow the ſame Authors Phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: They needed no perſwaſion to do it, but onely newes that others had done it: For as this alone if beleeved, makes all the reſt to be ſo too, ſo one thing alone diſliked, (where infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility is claimed) overthrowes all the reſt.</p>
            <p>If it were granted, that it agreeth not with the goodneſſe of God , to let men want an infallible Guide, and therefore there muſt be one, and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were it, yet if that teach any thing to my underſtanding contrary to Gods
<pb facs="tcp:165888:19"/>goodneſſe, I am not to receive her Doctrine, for the ſame cauſe for which they would have me receive it, (it being as good an argument this guide teacheth things contrary to Gods goodneſſe, therefore this is not appointed by God, as to ſay, it is agreeable to his goodneſſe there ſhould be one, therefore there is one) and ſure it is lawfull to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine particular Doctrines, whether they agree with that Principle, which is their foundation; and for that (me thinks) to damn him, that neither with negligence, nor prejudication, ſearches what is Gods will, (though he miſſe of it) is as contrary, as the firſt can be ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>Next, I would know, whether he, that hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall yet be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for not beleeving her infallible?</p>
            <p>I have ſo good an opinion of them, as to aſſure my ſelf, they will anſwer he ſhall not.</p>
            <p>I will then ask, whether he that hath ſearched what Religions there are, and finds hers to be one, and her infallibility to be a part of it, (if his reaſon will not aſſent to that) ſhall be damned for being inquiſitive after Truth, (for he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no other fault, greater then the other) and whether ſuch an ignorance, (I mean after impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall ſearch) be not of all other the moſt invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible?</p>
            <p>Nay, grant the Church to be infallible, yet me thinks, he that denies it, and imploies his reaſon to ſeek, if it be true, ſhould be in as good caſe, as he that beleeveth it, and ſearcheth not at all the truth of the Propoſition he receives; For I cannot ſee
<pb facs="tcp:165888:19"/>why he ſhould be ſaved, becauſe by reaſon of his parents beleef, or the Religion of the Country, or ſome ſuch accident, the Truth was offered to his underſtanding, when, had the contrary been offered, he would have received that. And the other damned, that beleeves falſhood upon as good ground, as the other doth truth, unleſſe the Church be like a Conjurers Circle, that will keep a man from the Divell, though he came unto it by chance.</p>
            <p>They grant no man is an Heretick, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves not his Hereſie obſtinately, and if he be no Heretick, he may ſure be ſaved; It is not then certain damnation for any man to deny the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but for him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that denies it obſtinately; And then I am ſafe, for I am ſure I do not; Neither can they ſay, I ſhall be damned for Schiſme, though not for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, for he is as well no Shciſmatick, though in Schiſme, that is willing, to joyne in Communion with the true Church, when it appears to be ſo to him, as he is no Heretick, though he holds He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall opinions, who holds them not obſtinately, that is (as I ſuppoſe) with a deſire to be informed if he be in the wrong.</p>
            <p>Next, Why if it be not neceſſary alwaies to beleeve the Truth, ſo one beleeve in generall what the Church would have beleeved, (for ſo they excuſe great men that have held contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to theirs now, before they were defined, or knew them to be ſo) why I ſay, ſhall not the ſame implicite aſſent ſerve to whatſoever God would
<pb facs="tcp:165888:20"/>have aſſented unto? (though I miſtake what that is:) when indeed to beleeve implicitely what God would have beleeved, is to beleeve implicitely likewiſe what the Church teacheth, if this Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine be within the number of thoſe, which God commands to be beleeved.</p>
            <p>I have the leſſe doubt of this opinion, that I ſhall have no harme for not beleeving the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe of my being ſo farr from leaning to the contrary, and ſo ſuffering my will to have power over my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that if God would leave it to me, which Tenet ſhould be true, I would rather chuſe, that that ſhould, then the contrary.</p>
            <p>For they may well beleeve me, that I take no pleaſure in tumbling hard and unpleaſant Books, and making my ſelf giddy with diſputing obſcure Queſtions, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. If I ſhould beleeve, there ſhould alwaies be, whom I might alwaies know, a ſociety of men, whoſe opinions muſt be certainely true, and who would <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, labour to diſcuſſe and define all ariſing doubts, ſo that I might be excuſably at eaſe, and have no part left for me but that of obedience, which muſt needs be a leſſe difficult, and ſo a more agreeable way, then to endure endleſſe Volumes of Commenters, the harſh <hi>Greek</hi> of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and the harder <hi>Latin</hi> of <hi>Trenaeus,</hi> and be pained by diſtinguiſhing between different ſences, and various Lections, and he would deſerve not the loweſt place in <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> that would preferr theſe ſtudies before ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb facs="tcp:165888:20"/>ſo more pleaſant; that would rather imploy his underſtanding then ſubmit it, and if he could think God impoſed upon him onely the reſiſting temptations, would by way of addition require from himſelf, the reſolving of doubts; yet I ſay not, that all theſe Books are to be read by thoſe that underſtand not the languages, (for them I conceive their ſeeking into the Scripture may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice) but he who hath by Gods grace skill to look into them, cannot better uſe it then in the ſearching of his will, where they ſay it is to be found, that he may aſſent to them, if there he find reaſon for it, or if not, they may have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for not excuſing him.</p>
            <p>For whereas they ſay it is pride makes us doubt of their Infallibilitie.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That their too much lazineſſe and impatience of examining is the cauſe, that many of them do not doubt.</p>
            <p>Next, what pride is it never to aſſent, before I find reaſon (ſince they, when they follow their Church as infallible, pretend reaſon for it, and will not ſay they would, if they thought they found none) and if they ſay, we do find reaſon, but will not confeſſe it, then pride hinders not our aſſent, but our declaration of it, which if it do in any one, he is without queſtion <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by himſelf, and it muſt be a very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Advocate, that would ſtrive to acquit him.</p>
            <p>One much prevailing argument, which they make, is this, That whoſoever leaves them, fall into diſſention between themſelves, whereas
<pb facs="tcp:165888:21"/>they in the mean while are allwaies at Unity.</p>
            <p>I anſwer,</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, In this whereof the Queſtion is now, they all aſſent.</item>
               <item>Secondly, When there is fire for them that diſagree, they need not bragg of their Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity who conſent.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, they have many differences among them, as whether the Pope be Infallible? whether God predeterminate every action? whether Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and Reprobation depend upon fore-ſight? Which ſeemes to me as great as any between their Adverſaries, and in the latter, the Jeſuites have ancienter, and generaller Tradition on their ſide, then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath in any other Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as much ground from Reaſon for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Gods goodneſſe, as they can think they have for the neceſſity of an infallible guide.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Yet theſe arguments muſt not make the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans</hi> Hercticks, and muſt us: If they ſay the Church hath not reſolved it, (which ſignifies onely that they are not agreed about it, which is that we object) I anſwer, It ought to have done ſo, if uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Ancient Church be required, in which all that ever I could heare of, before Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> (who is ever various I confeſſe in it) delivered the contrary to the <hi>Dominicans</hi> as not doubtfull; and to ſay it is lawfull for them to diſagree, whereſoever they do not agree, is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, (for they cannot do both at once about the ſame point) and if they ſay they mean by the Churches not having concluded it, that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb facs="tcp:165888:21"/>hath not: I Anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That they condemne ſome without any Councell, and why not theſe?</p>
            <p>Next, I ſay the opinion of the diffuſed Church is of more force, then the concluſion of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative (which hath its authority from the other) and therefore if all extant for the firſt four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered yeares taught any thing, it is more Hereſie to deny that, then any Cannon of a Councell; But may not howſoever any other Company of People (that would maintaine themſelves to be infallible) ſay as much, that all other Sects differ from one another, and therefore ſhould all agree with them, would not thoſe (think they) aſcribe all other mens diſſentions, and learned mens fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into diverſe hereſies to their not allowing their Infallibility, to their not aſſenting to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and not ſuffering them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to ſit as teachers of thoſe things that come in Queſtion, and to have all others in the place of Diſciples obedient to them, which is that which <hi>Nilus</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Biſhop profeſſed, that (becauſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> would not allow the <hi>Romans</hi>) was the chief cauſe of ſeparation between them.</p>
            <p>Next, They uſe much to object, how could errors come into the Church without oppoſition, and mention both of them, and the oppoſition to them in Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>I anſwer,</p>
            <p>They might come not at once, but by degrees, as in the growth of a Child, or motion of a Clock,
<pb facs="tcp:165888:22"/>we ſee neither in the preſent, but know there was a preſent when we find it paſt.</p>
            <p>Next, I ſay there are two ſorts of errors; To hold a thing neceſſary that is unlawfull, and falſe; or that is but profitable, and probable. Of the ſecond ſort, that errors ſhould come in, it appears not hard to me, (eſpecially in thoſe ages where want of Printing, made Books, and conſequently Learning, not ſo common as now it is, where the few that did ſtudy, buſied themſelves in Schoole ſpeculations onely, when the authority of a man of chief note, had a more generall influence then now it hath, and ſo as <hi>Thucidides</hi> ſaith the Plague did in his time, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the diſeaſe that firſt ſettled in the head EASILY paſſed through all the body, conſidering how apt men are to deſire that all men ſhould think as they do, and conſequently to lay a neceſſity upon the receiving that opinion, if they conceive that a way to have it received. And then if it were beleeved generally, profitable (as confeſſion) who would be apt to oppoſe their call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it necceſſary, for the ſame cauſe for which they called it ſo.</p>
            <p>Beſides, If this error were delivered by ſome Father in the hot oppoſition of ſome Heretick, it may be none would oppoſe it, leaſt the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries might take advantage by their diſſention, and he that diſputed for the Orthodox ſide, might loſe by it much of his authority.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>neceſſary</hi> it ſelf, is alſo often uſed for very convenient, and then from neceſſary in that
<pb facs="tcp:165888:22"/>ſence, to abſolutely neceſſary is no difficult change, though it be a great one.</p>
            <p>Then the Fathers uſe the word Hereticks, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a larger ſence, and ſometimes in a ſtricter, and ſo differ in the reckoning them up, ſome lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out thoſe that others put in, (though they had ſeen the precedent Catalogue) and ſo the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe of the ſence of theſe words might bring in error: Names alſo, as <hi>Altar, Sacrifice, Maſſe,</hi> may have been uſed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in one ſence, and the name retained though the thing ſignified received change; as it was once of an Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> 
               <hi>cui proprium fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it nuper reperta,</hi> (I leave out <hi>ſcelera</hi>) <hi>priſcis verbis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegere,</hi> whoſe property it was to cover things newly found with ancient tearmes, And the ſame Author tells us, that the ſame ſtate, was as it were, cheated out of her liberty, becauſe there did remaine <hi>eadem Magiſtratuum vocabula,</hi> the ſame titles of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates: And I beleeve, that if the Proteſtants beyond the Seas would have thought Biſhops as good a word as <hi>Super-intendents,</hi> (and ſo in other ſuch things) many, who underſtand nothing but names, would have miſſed the ſcandale they have now taken. Theſe waies I think theſe things may have come, without much oppoſition from being thought profitable to be done, and probable to be beleeved, to be thought neceſſary to be both; and how things may have been by little and little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived under old names, which would not have been ſo at once under new ones; it is not hard to conceive.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:165888:23"/>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:165888:25"/>Creator, the aid (whereof how much greater the wonder was to bee, and the neceſſity, now divers thouſand yeers by lamentable experience was more deer, ſo much the readier was he) and it was to ſend from his eternall breſt, his only wiſedome to recount us wonders, and averre them under the ſeal of his immutable truth. He knew all ſecrets, and could not be touched with ſuſpition of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; he was all goodneſs, and free from all calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of jealouſie or envie: who knew him, could not miſtruſt him, for beſide thoſe great Verdicts alreadie expreſſed in his favour, his works gave aſſurance of his words, he fulfilling in deeds, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he perſwaded in words, and working to himſelf, what he wiſhed unto others. Lo here, the high, and ſage Maſter of our faith, whoſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles we cannot miſ-doubt, ſo we be aſſured they are his; and who hath in vain ſpent ſo much ſweat, and pains, if after he paſſed from hence, he hath left no meanes to aſſure mankind, what it was hee taught and practiſed, and for the teaching and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing of it, eſchewed not the ſtormie paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Bethlehem</hi> and <hi>Mount Calvarie:</hi> but as in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> he multiplied the three drops of his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion into the thouſands of innocent Brooks; ſo upon the Mount <hi>Calvarie</hi> he opened the great Source, which hath now through 16. Ages irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated the world with an infinitie of ſtreames of proportionall examples of blood and ſufferance. Now was his Legacie performed, and hee from Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> triumphantly returned, from whence he was come, and the world left to be ſaved by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:165888:25"/>faith, that is, by a conſtant perſwaſion of thoſe things which he had taught.</p>
               <p>The Conditions of this Faith were three. Firſt, That it ſhould be a means fitting for humane kind, that is, for learned, and unlearned, for yong, and old, for wiſe, and fooles, for Princes and pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, Rabbies, and Ideots. Secondly, That it ſhould be a tenent, conſtant, undoubted, undiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, uncontroulable. Thirdly, That it ſhould be a rule of our life and actions, making but a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of this preſent life, to the following, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to contemn the preſent and ſeen ſubſtance, in hope of an unſeen and abſent fortune. <hi>Certes,</hi> a hard taske, and which needeth to be well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and founded by God himſelf. For who well conſidereth it, cannot doubt it, to be as great a miracle (to make the whole Maſſe of mankinde, to forſake what it ſeeth, and take to obſcure hopes or things, it does not ſo much apprehend what they are) as to force the ſtrongeſt works of nature, to hang the ſea in the aire, to alter the courſe of Moon, and Starres, and whatſoever elſe is ſtrange and incredible in nature. Beſides that, to make a way of knowledge common, and indifferent to learned, and unlearned, to make the ignorant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, what the learned cannot reach unto, and the learned die in defence of the truth he hath no other warrant for, then becauſe he hath learned it from an ignorant perſon, was the work of him alone who framed them both, and underſtood in what veins ſo different blouds doe run.</p>
               <p>But done it was to be, and how? Thoſe to whom
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:165888:26"/>during his life, he had moſt fully declared his mind, went, and told it to others, and all was done. We cannot denie the way to have been fitting, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, ſo it be found efficacious and powerfull to effect, what the Author intended. For if Faith muſt beleeve what Chriſt hath taught, what better inſtrument to breed faith, then who heard him ſpeak? If Faith muſt be common to learned, and unlearned, what better meanes, then by hearing? From which no unlearnedneſſe can excuſe, nor learnedneſſe be exempt. Every man may have from whom to hear and learn, if not a wiſer then himſelfe, yet one who may have properties to be a better witneſſe. Children naturally beleeve what their parents tell them, unlearned men what Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors teach them, abſent men, what thoſe who were preſent doe report. All this goeth very well, ſo that this Expedient prove efficacious to the end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>

                  </label> Yet if we look into the immediate progreſſe and joints of the deſcent, we cannot finde where it can miſſe, for the doctrine being ſupernaturall, and not delivered by mans skill or wit, the firſt and main
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:165888:26"/>principle of it can be no other, then to know what was delivered them by their Teachers, a thing not ſurpaſſing the underſtanding of any ſenſible wiſe man; ſo that put but twenty wiſe underſtanding men to agree, that the Preacher, to their certaine knowledge, ſaid ſuch a thing, there remaineth no probable nor poſſible doubt, but that it was ſo.</p>
               <p>Now then ſuppoſe, that one of thoſe (who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been taught by Chriſts own mouth, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the confirmation of the Holy Ghoſt, that he could neither forget nor forgoe this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived doctrine) ſhould have preached over and over again the ſame doctrine not long, nor hard to be carryed away in all the Cities, Towns, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs of ſome great Country, ſo that whilſt he ſtayd there, they were throughly underſtanding and endoctrinated in that way. Now let him be gone, and after him all dead, who had heard him ſpeake; and then ſome queſtion ariſe concerning this doctrine (as we may ſay in the ſecond age) let us ſee whether error can creep in or no, if the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians keepe unto their hold. Their hold is what they were taught by Chriſts Apoſtles. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wiſeſt and beſt men of thoſe Cities and Towns meet together about the controverſie, and diſcuſſe it out of this principle (what was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto them as taught by the Apoſtles) will not there be a quick end of their diſpute? For every man can ſay, My father heard the Apoſtle ſpeak, he underſtood him to have ſaid this, ſo he himſelfe beleeved, ſo he taught me, that this was that which, the Apoſtle taught us. And when
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:165888:27"/>out of divers Cities and Towns, ſhall come a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of witneſſes, all agreeing in one point, how can it be doubted, but that this is Chriſts doctrine, and that which his Apoſtle taught? And to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree how is it poſſible? Since all their fathers heard the ſame things, and things not above their capacity, and often told them, and well apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them when they were taught, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence could not tell their children otherwiſe then what they had heard and underſtood, in a matter of ſuch moment, and of which they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended no leſſe, then that it concerned their own, and their childrens ſalvation, happineſſe, or miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for all eternity. And what here is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently certaine, in the children of thoſe who heard the Apoſtles, may be derived with as much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence again in the grand-children, and ſo in every age even to our preſent; for if in any age any queſtion beginne, and it be reduced unto this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; what did our forefathers teach us? neither can there be any pretended ignorance (for who can be ignorant of what was taught him when he was a childe, and in what he was bred, as in the grounds and ſubſtance of his hopes, for all eternity?)</p>
               <p>True it is, that if men leave this principle, and ſeek to judge the controverſie by learned diſcourſe, then may the, Church be divided, one part follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authority of their Anceſtors; the other the ſubtle Arguments, and the great opinion they conceive, of the learning of their preſent Teachers: ſo that one ſide will claime ſucceſſion, and to have received it from hand to hand; the other the glory
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:165888:27"/>of great learning, and to have come by great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to diſcover the errors of their forefathers. But it is evident, that if what the Apoſtles preached be the touchſtone of what is true, and what they preached to be ſeen in what thoſe beleeve who have heard them, and they who received it, from them that heard them; It is moſt evident, I ſay, that the one part, who ſeek for Chriſtian truth in learned diſcourſe, muſt needs forgoe the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and eaſie way, of attaining unto what they aime at: And likewiſe evident, that who keep themſelves duly and carefully unto this principle cannot poſſibly in any continuance of time, ſwerve from the truth which Chriſt hath left unto his Church. So that the whole difficulty is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto this, whether the Church for ſo many ages be perpetually preſerved in this principle, that what ſhe received from her forefathers is, that ſhe muſt beleive, and deliver unto her poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; A thing ſo grafted in nature; which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us receive our being, our breeding, our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, our goods, our eſtates, our arts, and all things we have, from our fathers, that it is a wonder of our mutability, that without forcible Engines we can be drawn from it.</p>

               <p>NOw let us turn our diſcourſe, and as we have ſeen, that if our Saviour ordred his Apoſtles in the manner explicated, there was no way for his Church to ſwerve from his truth, but by ſwerving from the moſt plain, the moſt naturall, and moſt evident, and concluding rule of his doctrine, and that but one, and moſt eaſie; ſo let us ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the preſent Church we can draw the like forcible train, which may lead us up to Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Be therefore ſuppoſed or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, what no judicious man can deny to ſee with his eyes, if he hath never ſo little caſt them upon this preſent religion of Chriſtendome, to wit, that there is one Congregation or Church which layeth claime to Chriſt his doctrine, as upon this title, that ſhe hath received it from his Apoſtles without interruption, delivered ever from Father to Sonne, from Maſter to Scholler, from time to time, from hand to hand, even unto this day; and that ſhe does not admit any other doctrine for good and legitimate, which ſhe does not receive in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Againe, that whoſoever pretendeth Chriſt his truth againſt her, ſaith, that true it is, that once ſhe had the true way, but that by length of time ſhe is fallen into groſſe errours which they will reforme, not by any truth they have received from hand to hand, from thoſe who by both parts are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have received their leſſon from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:165888:28"/>Chriſt and his Apoſtles, but by ſtudy and learned Arguments, either out of ancient Writers, or out of the ſecrets of nature and reaſon. This being ſuppoſed, either this principle hath remained unto her ſince the beginning, or ſhe took it up in ſome one age of the 16 ſhe hath endured; if ſhe took it up in ſome latter age, ſhe then thought ſhe had nothing in her what ſhe had not received from her fore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this ſort: And if ſhe thought ſo, ſhe knew it. For as it is impoſſible now any country ſhould think it was generally taught, ſuch a thing if it were not ſo; ſo alſo was there the like neceſſity, and impoſſibility to be otherwiſe, if all men were not runne mad. Therefore clear it is, ſhe took it not up firſt then, but was in former poſſeſſion, and ſo clear it is, that ſhe could not have it now, if ſhe had it not from the very beginning. Now if ſhe had it, and hath conſerved it from the beginning, no new opinion could take root in her, unleſſe it came unto her under this Maxime, as received from hand, to hand; and to ſay, that any opinion which was not truly received from hand to hand, ſhould by ſuch a community be accepted, as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from hand to hand, is to make it beleeve, what it ſeeth clearly to be falſe, to lye unto it's own ſoule, againſt it's own ſoule, and the ſoule of it's poſterity. Let us adde to this, that the multitude of this Church is ſo diſperſed through ſo many Countries and languages of ſo divers governments, that it is totally impoſſible they ſhould agree together, or meet upon a falſe determination, to affirme with one conſent a falſity for truth, no intereſt being able to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:165888:29"/>be common unto them all to produce ſuch an effect. Wherefore as an underſtanding man cannot chuſe but laugh at the ſelf-weening <hi>Hampſhire</hi> Clown, who thinks in his heart there was no ſuch Country as <hi>France,</hi> and that all that was told of it were but Travellers tales, becauſe himſelfe being upon the Sea ſhore, had ſeen nothing but water beyond <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> ſo I think no wiſe man will accompt him leſſe then phrentick, that underſtandeth ſo little in humane wayes, as to think whole Nations by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, or by hazard, can agree together to profeſſe, and proteſt a thing, which they know of their own knowledge to be a meer lye, and a well known falſhood to themſelves, and all their neighbours.</p>

               <p>THe force of the declared linke of ſucceſſion, is ſo manifeſt to a capable underſtanding, that being compared with any objection made againſt it, it will of it ſelfe maintain it's evidence, and bear down the greateſt oppoſitors and oppoſition, if the underſtanding be left unto it ſelfe, and not wreſted by the prejudice of a ſome wayes intereſſed will. Nevertheleſſe, there is a deeper root, which greatly ſtrengthens and reduceth into action, the former efficacity of the tradition. And this is, that Chriſtian doctrine is not a ſpeculative knowledge, inſtituted for delight of man to entertain his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and hath no further end then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation which ariſeth out of contemplation; but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:165888:29"/>it is an art of living, a rule of attaining unto eternall bliſſe, a practicall doctrine whoſe end is to informe our action, that our life and actions ſquared by her directions, may lead us to that great good, the which God Almighty eſteemed ſo highly of; that he thought it reaſon enough for himto ſhade his Divinity under the miſery of man, to make us partakers of ſo great a bliſſe. Hence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that no error can fall, even in a point which ſeemeth wholly ſpeculative in Chriſtian faith, but ſoone it breedeth a practicall effect, or rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Chriſtian behaviour. What could ſeem more ſpeculative, then whether the ſecond, or third Perſons of the Trinity were truly or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipately God? Yet no ſooner was an error broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe queſtions, but there followed a great alteration in Chriſtian action; in their Baptiſmes, in their manner of Prayer, in the motives of Love and Charity toward Almighty God, the very ground-work and foundation of all Chriſtian life. Whether man hath free-will or no, ſeemeth a queſtion, belonging to the nature of man, fit for a curious Phyloſopher; but upon the preaching of the negative part, preſently followed an unknowen Libertinage, men yeilding themſelves over to all concupiſcence, ſince they were perſwaded they had no power to reſiſt, free-will being denyed. I need not inſtance in prayer to Saints, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Images, prayer for the dead, and the like; which is evident, could not be changed without an apparent change in Chriſtian Churches. So that a doctrine contrary to faith, is like a diſeaſe,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:165888:30"/>which although the cauſe be internall, yet cannot the effects and ſymptomes be kept from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts and view of the world. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which this note draweth, is, that it is not poſſible, that any materiall point of Chriſtian faith can be changed, as it were by obreption, whilſt men are on ſleepe, but it muſt needs raiſe a great ſcandall and tumult in the Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale. For ſuppoſe the Apoſtles had taught the world it were Idolatry to pray to Saints, or uſe reverence towards their Pictures: How can we imagine this honour brought in, without a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement conflict and tumult, in a people which did ſo greatly abhor Idolatry, as the Apoſtles, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples did? I might make the like inſtance in other points, if the whole Hiſtory of the Church did not conſiſt of the invaſions made by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, and the great and moſt violent waving of the Church to and fro upon thoſe occaſions. We remember in a manner as yet, how change came into <hi>Germany, France, Scotland,</hi> and our own Country: Let thoſe be a ſigne to us, what we may thinke can be the creeping in of falſe doctrine; ſpecially, that there is no point of doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Catholique Church, rooted in any Chriſtian Nation, that the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory does not mention the times and combats by which it entred, and tore the Church in peices.</p>
               <p>Let it therefore remaine for moſt evidently conſtant, that into the Chriſtian Church can come no error, but it muſt be ſeen and noted, and raiſe ſcandall and oppoſition to ſhew it ſelfe (as truly it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:165888:30"/>is) contrary to the nature of Piety and Religion.</p>
               <p>And when it does come, it cannot draw after it any others, then ſuch as firſt deſert the root of Faith, and Anchor of Salvation, that is to be judged by what their fore-fathers taught them, and affirmed to have received from their Anceſtors, as the Faith which Chriſt and his Apoſtles delivered to the whole world of their time, and to ſuch as ever claime and maintaine the right of ſucceſſion, as rule of what they beleeve. Yet may this alſo be worthy of conſideration, that as in our naturall body, the principall parts are defended by Bones, Fleſh, Skinnes, and ſuch like defences, in ſuch ſort, that no outward Agent can come to offend them, before having annoyed ſome of theſe; ſo in the Catholique faith, there are in ſpeculation thoſe we call Theologicall concluſions, and other pious opinions; and in practiſe many Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which ſtop the paſſage unto the maine principall parts of Chriſtian beleife and action. And about theſe we ſee daily ſuch great motions in the Catholique Church, that he muſt be very ignorant of the Spirit of God, which quickneth his Church, that can imagine any vitall part of his faith can be wounded while it lyes aſleep, and is inſenſible of the harm befalleth it; for as in any Science a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple cannot be miſtaken, but it muſt needs draw a great ſhoale of falſe conſequence upon it, and lame the whole Science, ſo never ſo little an error in faith can be admitted, but in other Tenets and Ceremonies it muſt needs make a great change, and innovation.</p>

               <p>NOw let any diſcreet man conſider, what further evidence he can deſire, or peradventure, what greater aſſurance nature can afford, and not be of an awkward wilfulneſſe to aske, that which is not conformable to the lawes of nature? Much like unto him, who being ſate in a chaire far from the chimney, could not think of applying himſelfe to the fire, but was angry the fire and chimney were made ſo far from him. The Phyloſophers ſay, it is <hi>indiſciplinati ingenii</hi> to expect in any Art or Science more exactneſſe then the nature of it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth. As if a man would bind a Seaman, to goe ſo far every day, whether wind and weather ſerved or no: So in morall matters, and ſuch as are ſubject to humane action, we muſt expect ſuch aſſurance as humane actions, beare. If for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of your ſpirituall life, you have as much as for the managing of your naturall and civill life, what can you expect more? Two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of men, beyond exception, will caſt a man out of, not onely his lands, but life and all.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:165888:31"/>may caſt our ſelves on? and for the reſt remem ber we are men, creatures ſubject to chance and mutability, and thank God he hath given us that aſſurance in a ſupernaturall way, which we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent withall, in our naturall and civill ventures and poſſeſſions, which nevertheleſſe God knoweth we often love better, and would leſſe hazard then the unknowne good of the life to come. Yet perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, God hath provided better for his Church then for Nature, ſince he loved her more, and in his own Perſon did more for her. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examine the aſſurance he hath left her parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly. It was found in the ſecond Chapter, upon this principle, that ſo great a multitude of men as cleave to this ground (to have received their faith by tradition) could not conſpire by lying, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their poſterity. And if I be not deceived, this principle being granted, the concluſion (that this preſent Church is the true) followeth in as ſevere a way of diſcourſe, as in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Organ is taught, and exemplified in <hi>Mathematicall</hi> Writers; whoſe uſe and art it is to put the like ſuppoſitions, whence to enduce ſomething out againſt their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. As in the ſaid Chapter you are bidden, to put what yeare, or age ſuch an error entred, and it is evidently true, that if it be true, then that yeare or age conſpired to tell a lye to deceive their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. And as for the ſtrength of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it ſelfe (although no morall man can be ſo abſurd as to doubt of it) yet may we conſider, that the underſtanding being the part, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth man to be a man, and truth being the perfection
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:165888:32"/>of our underſtanding, and true ſpeech the effect, naturall to true knowledge, or underſtanding: It is cleare, that to ſpeak truth is as naturall a fruit of mans nature, as Peares of a Peare tree, Grapes of a Vine, Hony of the Bee: and that it can be no leſſe grafted in nature, for men to ſpeak truly, then it is in any other naturall cauſe to yeeld the fruit, for whoſe ſake nature bred the cauſe. Wherefore as the conſtancy of the effect ſheweth, that it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth upon eternall principles, that no one ſpecies of perfect creatures can periſh, although we are not ſo skilfull of nature, as hanſomely to weave the demonſtration; ſo cannot it be doubted, but that if one had all the principles of mans nature well digeſted, he might demonſtratively deduce the impoſſibility, of (that ſuch multitudes of men ſhould conſpire to a lye) the variety of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, ever holding their being from a conſtancy and uniformity in the univerſall. Adde to this the notoriouſneſſe of the lye, ſuch as he is rarely found, that is, ſo wicked as to venture upon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the greatneſſe of the ſubject, and of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger enſuing upon himſelfe, and his deareſt pledges. The ground therefore aſſumed, is a demonſtrative principle, and peradventure in a higher degree then moſt phyſicall principles be: For who knoweth not the nature of the ſoule, to be the higheſt thing Phyſicks can reach unto? Who knoweth not, that immateriall things are leſſe ſubject to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability then thoſe which are grounded in matter? Then as more noble, and as more immateriall, it hath greater exemption from mutability, then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:165888:32"/>any other naturall cauſe whatſoever. One addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more, may chance to cleare the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe more fully. Nothing more cleare then that, no naturall cauſe faileth of his effect, without there be ſome impediment from a ſtronger. Now the impediments which hinder a man from ſpeaking truth, experience teacheth us, to be no other then hopes and feares. The ſame experience giveth us to know, that it is a rare thing, that hopes and feares ſhould comprehend ſo great multitudes, as are in the union of the Catholique Church, ſpecially during an age, which is the leaſt time neceſſary for the effect we ſpeak of; that what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure might at one time be ill admitted, ſhould not be rejected at another. But if there were; can any man be ſo mad as to think, it could be a ſecret hope or feare, which ſhould not break our amongſt the poſterity, and be knowen, that what was done was not true, but counterfeited upon feare or intereſt, which if it were, a whole ages counterfeiting would not be ſufficient to make the poſterity beleeve, they had received ſuch a point of doctrine by tradition. Wherefore I doe not ſee, how this principle of tradition, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine received by it, can be accompted of leſſe certainty, then any Phyſicall demonſtration what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; or Faith upon this ground not as ſure as any naturall cauſe, as the courſe of Sunne and Moon, as the flowing and ebbing of the Sea, as the Summer and Winter, Sowing and Harveſt, and whatſoever we undoubtedly preſume upon the like nature, and kind.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:165888:33"/>
               <p>The principle which is taken in the following Chapter, is of no leſſe force (if not of far better) to who rightly underſtandeth the nature of God his workes, whoſe courſe it is deeplier to root and ſtrengthen thoſe things which he would have moſt to flouriſh, or whereof he hath moſt care. Now Chriſtians well know, that God Almighty hath made mankind for his elect, as the world which is about us for mankind. And therefore he hath rooted thoſe things which more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately belong to the Elect (as is his Church, his Faith, and Holy Spirit in it) more ſtrongly then the principles either of mans nature, or of, the world which was made for it: himſelfe aſſuring us of it, when he told us, <hi>One title ſhould not miſſe of the holy Writ, though Heaven and Earth ſhould be diſſolved.</hi> And ſo ſeeing the latter principle, relyed upon the not failing of Gods Holy Spirit to his Church, which ſhould ever watch upon their actions, that nothing ſhould creep into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life, which perſently the zeale of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhould not ſtartle at. I think it needleſſe to ſeek to further <hi>qualifie</hi> the ſtrength of that part, which receiveth it from the quality of ſo good a workman as was the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

               <p>I Doubt not but whoſoever ſhall have received ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the diſcourſe paſſed, will alſo have received in that point we ſeeke after; that is in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſured both that Chriſt hath left a Director in the world, and where to find him, there being left no doubt, but it is his holy Church upon earth. Nor can there be any queſtion, which is this Church, ſithence there is but one that doth and can lay claime, to have received from hand to hand his holy doctrine in writings and hearts. Others may cry loud, they have found it, but they muſt firſt confeſſe it was loſt: and ſo if they have, it was not received by hands, I meane, as far as it diſagreeth with Catholique doctrine; ſo that where there is not ſo much as claime, there can be no diſpute. And that this Church is a lawfull directreſſe, that is, hath the conditions requiſite, I think can no wayes be doubted. Let us conſider in her, preſence, or viſibility, authority, power. As for the firſt, her multitude and ſucceſſion, makes the Church if ſhe is ever acceſſible, ever knowen. The <hi>Arrians</hi> ſeemed to chaſe her out of the world in their flouriſh, but the perſecution moved againſt her, made her even then well known and admired. In our owne Countrey we have ſeen no Biſhop, no forme of Church for many yeares; yet never ſo, but that the courſe of juſtice did proclaime her through <hi>England,</hi> and who was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:165888:34"/>curious could never want meanes to come to know her confeſſion of faith what it is, and upon what it is grounded. Whereſoever ſhe is, if in peace, her Majeſty and Ceremonies in all her actions, make her ſpectable and admired. If in war, ſhe never wanteth Champions to maintain her, and the very heat of her adverſaries, makes her known to ſuch as are deſirous to underſtand the truth of a matter ſo important, as is the eternall welfare of our ſoule.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Authority:</hi> her very claime of antiquity and ſucceſſion (to have been that Church which received her beginning from Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and never forewent it, but hath ever main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it) giveth a great reverence unto her amongſt thoſe, who beleeve her, and amongſt thoſe, who with indifferency and love of truth, ſeek to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; a great prejudice above others: For it draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a greater likelyhood of truth, then others have. And if it be true, it carrieth an infinite authority with it, of Biſhops, Doctors, Martyrs, Saint, miracles, learning, wiſedome, venerable antiquity, and the like: that if a prudent man ſhould ſit with himſelfe and conſider, that if he were to chuſe what kind of one he would have it, to carry away the hearts of men towards the admiration and love of God Almighty, he could find nothing wanting in this, that could be maintained with the fluxibility of nature. For to ſay, he would have no wicked men in it, were to ſay, he would have it made of Angels and not of Men.</p>
               <p>There remaineth <hi>Power:</hi> the which no man
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:165888:34"/>can doubt but Chriſt hath given it moſt ample, who conſidereth his words ſo often repeated to his Apoſtles. But (abſtracting from that) who doth not ſee, that the Church hath the nature and proportion of ones Country, unto every one? As in a mans Country, he hath Father, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Brothers, Siſters, Kinsfolkes, Allyes, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and Country-men, which anciently were called <hi>Cives,</hi> or <hi>Concives,</hi> and of theſe are made his Country; ſo in the Church findeth he in way of ſpirituall inſtruction and education, all theſe degrees neerer and farther off, until he come unto that further moſt of being, of all united under the univerſall Government of Chriſt his Vicar: And as he in his Countrey findeth bearing, breeding, ſettling in eſtates and fortunes, and laſtly protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſecurity; ſo likewiſe in the way of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity doth he find this more fully in the Church: ſo that if it be true, that a man oweth more unto his Maſter then unto his Father, becauſe <hi>bene eſſe</hi> is better then <hi>eſſe:</hi> certainly a man alſo (as far as Church and Country can be ſeparated) muſt owe more to the Church then to his very Country; wherefore likewiſe the power which the Church hath to command and inſtruct, is greater then the power of the temporall Country, and community, whereof he is part; Againe, this Church can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie learned and unlearned. For in matters above the reach of reaſon, whoſe ſource and ſpring is from what Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught, what learned man, that underſtands the nature of ſcience and method, can refuſe in his inmoſt ſoule to bow
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:165888:35"/>to that which is teſtified by ſo great a multitude, to have come from Chriſt: And what unlearned man can require more for his faith, then to be taught by a Miſtreſſe of ſo many prerogatives and advantages above all others? Or how can he think to be quieted in conſcience, if he be not content to fare as ſhe doth, who hath this prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, evident that none is ſo likely by thouſands of degrees.</p>

               <p>THe ſtemme and body of our poſition thus raiſed, will of it ſelfe ſhoot out the branches of divers Queſtions, or rather the ſolution thereof.</p>
               <p>And firſt, <hi>How it hapned that diverſe Heretiques have pretended tradition</hi> (<hi>the</hi> Millenarians, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocratians, Gnoſtiaks, <hi>and divers others</hi>) <hi>yet they with their traditions have been rejected, and the holy Church left onely in claime of tradition?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if we look into, what Catholique tradition is, and what the ſaid Heretiques pretended, under the name of Tradition, the queſtion will remain voided. For the Catholique Church calleth Tradition, that doctrine which was publikely preached in the Churches, ordred and planted in the manners and cuſtomes of the Church. The Heretiques called Tradition a kind of ſecret do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, either gathered out of private converſation with the Apoſtles, or rather they pretended that the Apoſtles, beſides what they publikely taught
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:165888:35"/>the world, had another private or myſticall way proper to Schollers, more endeared then the reſt, which came not to publike view, but was in hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>germugger delivered from thoſe ſecret Diſciples unto others, and ſo unto them; where it is eaſily ſeen, what difference there is betwixt this Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Tradition and this pretended. For (the force and energie of tradition reſiding in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of hearers, and being planted in the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall action, and life of Chriſtians, ſo that it muſt have ſuch a publicity that it cannot be unknown amongſt them.) Thoſe the Heretiques pretend both manifeſtly, want the life and being of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and by the very great report of them loſe all authority and name. For, ſuppoſe ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vare doctrine of an Apoſtle to ſome Diſciple, ſhould be publiſhed and recorded by that Diſciple, and ſome others, this might well be a truth, but would never obtain the force of a Catholique po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that is, ſuch as it ſhould be damnation to reject, becauſe the deſcent from the Apoſtle is not notorious, and fitting to ſway the body of the whole Church.</p>
               <p>The Second Queſtion may be, <hi>How it commeth to paſſe, that ſomething which at firſt bindeth not the Churches beleef, afterward commeth to bind it? For if it were ever a Tradition it muſt ever be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and bind the Church: And if once it were not, it appeareth not how ever it could come to be; for if this age, (for example) hath it not, how can it deliver it over to the next age that followeth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we conſider, that the hope of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:165888:36"/>being great, and the Apoſtles preaching in ſo great varietie of Countries, it might happen ſome point in one Countrie to have been leſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, or peradventure not preached at all, which in another was often preached, and well both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and retained, we may eaſily free our ſelves from theſe brambles. For the Spirit of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſiding in this, that the teſtimony of that, <hi>the Apoſtles delivered this Doctrine</hi> be <hi>exceptione majus,</hi> and beyond all danger of deceit; It is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the efficaciouſneſs of Tradition, that the whole univerſall Church be witneſſe to ſuch a truth, but ſo great a part as could be a Warrant againſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking and deceit; ſo that if all the Churches of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> or <hi>Greece,</hi> or <hi>Aphrique,</hi> or <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly affirm ſuch a Doctrine to have been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto them by the Apoſtles, it were enough to make a Doctrine <hi>exceptione majorem:</hi> Whence it inſueth that if in a meeting of the Univerſall Church it were found that ſuch a part had ſuch a Tradition, concerning ſome matter, whereof the reſt either had no knowledge or no certainty, ſuch a Doctrine would paſſe into a neceſſary bond in the whole Church, which before was either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known or doubted of in ſome part thereof. A likely example thereof might be in the Canonicall bookes, the which being written ſome to one Church, and ſome to another, by little and little were ſpread from thoſe Churches unto others, and ſo ſome ſooner, ſome later, received into the conſtant beleife of the Catholique world.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:165888:36"/>
               <p>The Third queſtion may be, <hi>How (Chriſtian religion, conſiſting in ſo many points) it is poſsible to be kept incorrupted by tradition, the which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on memory, and our memory being ſo fraile, and ſubject to variation, it ſeemeth, cannot without manifeſt miracle, conſerve ſo great diverſity of points unchanged, for ſo many ages?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we conſider, that Faith is a Science, and Science a thing whoſe parts are ſo connexed, that if one be falſe, all muſt needs be falſe, we ſhall eaſily ſee that contrarily; the multitude of divers points is a conſervation the one to the other. For, if one be certaine, it of it ſelfe is able to bring us to the right in another, whereof we doubt. And as in a mans body, if he wanteth one member, or the operation of it, he muſt needs find the want of it in another: And as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth that is well ordained, cannot miſſe any office or part, without the redounding of the deſſect upon the whole, or ſome other part; ſo a Chriſtian, being an eſſence inſtituted by God, as ſpecially as any naturall creature, hath not the parts of his faith and action by accident and chance knitted together, but all parts by a naturall order, and will of the Maker, ordred for the conſervation of the moſt inward eſſence, which is the charity we owe to God, and our Neighbour. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſtian life and action conſiſteth but upon one main tradition, whoſe parts be thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which men ſpecifie, either in matter of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe or Action: So that this connextion of its parts amongſt themſelves, added to the Spirit
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:165888:37"/>of God, ever conſerving zeale in the heart of his Church, with thoſe helpes alſo of nature (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we ſee wonders in this kind done) will ſhew this conſervation to be ſo far from impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, that it will appeare a moſt con-naturall and fitting thing. Let us but conſider, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant nations, their language, their habits, their manners of ſacrificing, eating, generally living; how long it doth continue amongſt them. See that forlorne nation of <hi>Jewes,</hi> how conſtantly it maintaineth the Scripture? how obſtinately their errors? The <hi>Arabians</hi> of the deſert, from <hi>Iſmael</hi> his time unto this day, live in families, wandring about the deſert. Where Chriſtians labour to convert Idolaters, they find the maine and onely argument for their errors, that they received them from their fore-fathers, and will not quit them. The King of <hi>Socotora,</hi> thinking to pleaſe the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi> by reducing a nation, that had the name of Chriſtians, to true Chriſtianity, he found them obſtinately proteſt unto him, that they would ſooner loſe their lives, then part with the religion their Anceſtors had left them. The <hi>Maronites,</hi> a ſmall handfull of people, amongſt <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Heretiques,</hi> to this day have maintained their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in <hi>Siria.</hi> And certainly thouſands of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this kind may be collected in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Countries; eſpecially, if they be either rude, and ſuch as mingle not with others, or ſuch as be wiſe, and out of wiſedome ſeek to maintaine their ancient beleefe. And Catholiques are of both natures: For they have ſtrict commands,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:165888:37"/>not to come to the Ceremonies and Rites of other religions, and in their own, they have all meanes imaginable to affect them to it, and conſerve a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and zeale towards it.</p>

               <p>TO come at length to the principall aime of this Treatiſe, that is, to give an anſwer to him that demandeth a guide at my hands. I remit him to the moderne preſent viſible Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, her, who is in an externe ſenſible commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the externe ſenſible Clergy of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the externe ſenſible Head and Paſtour of the Church. If he aske me now, how he ſhall know her? (I ſuppoſe he meaneth, how he ſhould know her to be the true) I muſt contreinterrogate him, who he is? that is, in whoſe name he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth? Is he an ignorant man? Is he unlearned? yet of good underſtanding in the world? Is he a Scholler? and what Scholler? A Gramarian, whoſe underſtanding hath no other helpe then of languages? Is he a Phyloſopher? Is he a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine? (I meane an Academicall one, for a true Divine is to teach, not to aske this queſtion:) Is he a Stateſman? For he who can think one anſwer, can or ought be made to all theſe; may likewiſe expect, that a round bowle may ſtop a ſquare hole, or one cauſe produce all effects, and hang lead at his heels to fly withall. Yet I deny not, but all theſe muſt have the ſame guide,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:165888:38"/>though they are to be aſſured of, that in divers ſorts and manners. If therefore the ignorant man ſpeaketh, I will ſhew him in the Church of God an excellencie in decencie, Majeſtie of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies above all other Sects and Religions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by dull capacities are ſweetly enſnared, to beleeve the truth they hear, from whom they ſee to have the outward Signs of vertue and devotion. If the unlearned ask; I ſhew him the claim of Antiquitie, the multitude, the advantages of ſanctity and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the juſtifiableneſs of the cauſe, how the world was once in this accord, and thoſe who oppoſed, when they firſt parted, firſt began the Schiſm; how the points of difference be ſuch as on the Catholike ſide help devotion, and on the contrary diminiſh the ſame, and ſuch like ſenſible differences which will clearly ſhew a main advantage on the Catholike ſide, which is the proportionall motive to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: To the Grammarian I will give two <hi>Memorandums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, that ſeeing Catholiques were firſt in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion both of the Scriptures and the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the adverſe part is bound to bring ſuch places as can receive no probable Expoſition by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes. It is not ſufficient that their Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſeem good or better; that is, more confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable unto the Text, but they muſt be evincent, to which no ſo ſound anſwer, even with ſome impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety can be given. For who knoweth not, that is converſant in Criticks, how many obſcure, and difficult places occurre in moſt plain Authors: and the Scripture of all Books (the greater part of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:165888:38"/>the men who wrote them, ſpecially the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being not eloquent, and writing not in their native tongue) for the moſt part are ſubject to many Improprieties.</p>
               <p>The other <hi>Memorandum</hi> is, That to prove a Catholike point by Scripture, it is ſufficient that the place brought, do bear the Explication the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike beareth, and if it be more probable by the very letter, it is an evincent place. The reaſon is, Becauſe the Queſtion being about a Chriſtian Law, the Axioms of the Juriſts taketh place that <hi>Conſuetudo optima interpres Legis.</hi> So that if it be manifeſt that Chriſtian practiſe (which was before the controverſie) be for the one ſenſe, and the words be tolerable, no force of Grammar can prevail to equalize this advantage. The Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian therefore who will obſerve theſe rules, I turn him looſe to the Scriptures, and Fathers to ſeek in them what is the faith of Chriſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, of his Church to know her by. Of the the Philoſopher I exact to go like a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and to ſearch out the pecificall differences of every Sect, and when he hath found them, <hi>if any one but the Catholike hath any rule of Faith and good life:</hi> which I remit to him to enquire? But at leaſt when he hath found the Catholiques to be this claim of Tradition before declared, then, if this doe not bring him as demonſtratively, as he knoweth any concluſion in Philoſophie, and Mathematicks, to the notice that this is the only true Church of Chriſt, for my part I ſhall quit him before God and man. The Divine if he hath tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:165888:39"/>underſtood the principles of his Faith in the nature of a Divine (I mean, <hi>Trinity, Incarnation, Redemption, Euchariſt, Beatitude,</hi> the <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of the World) and hath ſeen the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act conformitie with the deepeſt principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with an unſpeakable wiſedome of the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: If he does not plainly confeſſe it was above the nature of man to frame the Catholike-Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſeeth not that onely, that is conformable to nature and it ſelfe; I ſay, he hath no ground ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to be of it. At laſt, the Stateſman who is truly informed of the Church, (how far it is really of Chriſts Inſtitution, and what either pious men have added, or peradventure, ambitious men encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,) If he does not find a government of ſo high and Exotick ſtrain, that neither mans wit would dare to have attempted it, neither mans power could poſſibly have effected it. If he findeth not eminent helpes, and no diſadvantage to the temporall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, I ſhall think there wanteth one Star in the Heaven of the Church, to direct theſe Sages to <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> But if God Almighty hath in all ſorts and manners provided his Church, that ſhe may enlighten every man in his way, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the way of a man; then let every man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, which is the fit way for himſelfe, and what in other matters of that way he accompteth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And, if there be no intereſt in his ſoule, to make him loath to beleeve, what in another matter of the like nature he would not ſtick at, or heavy to practiſe what he ſeeth clearly enough, I feare not his choice; but if God ſend him time
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:165888:39"/>and meanes to proſecute his ſearch any indifferent while, it is long ago known of what religion he is to be of</p>

               <head>After this followeth no order of Chapters, becauſe it is applied to the diſcourſe which was occaſion of it.</head>
               <p>Although if what is already be not ſatisfaction unto the writing, and the Author thereof, (for whoſe ſake and contentment, all that hath been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed hitherto, hath been ſet down:) I confeſſe, that I have not ability to give him ſatisfaction: yet leaſt it ſhould be interpreted neglect, If I did not make an application of it unto the writing, I ſhall as breifly as I can, for avoiding tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, runne over the diſcourſe. And true it is, ſpeaking of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as this day it is the true Church of God: I anſwer the doubter, ſhe neither hath, nor can have any error, which he need to feare, and be ſhye of. The which two limitations I adde, for avoiding queſtions, impertinent to our diſcourſe. The firſt, for thoſe which are concerning the connection of the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> to the univerſall Church. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to avoid ſuch queſtions as touch that point, whether the Church may erre, in any Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall or other ſuch like matter? which queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not ſo pertinent to our matter.</p>
               <p>Neither doe I remit the Queſtioner unto Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for his ſatisfaction, although I hold Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:165888:40"/>a very ſufficient meanes, to ſatisfie the man, who goeth to it with that preparation of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and will, which is meet and required. Howſoever this I may anſwer, for them who prove it out of Scripture, that becauſe they diſpute againſt them who admit of Scripture, and deny the authority of the Church, if they can convince it, they doe well; though they will not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves admit generally of a proofe our of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as not able to prove every thing in <hi>foro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentioſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they ſay, the Church is made infallible, that we may have ſome guide, I think it very rationall. For nature hath given ever ſome ſtrong and uncontroulable principle in all natures to guide the reſt. The Common-wealth hath a Governour not queſtionable, our underſtanding hath ſome principles, which ſhe cannot judge, but by them judgeth of all other verities. If there ſhould not be ſome ſuch principle in the Church, it were the onely maimed thing God had created; and maimed in its principall part, in the very head. And if there be ſuch a principle, the whole Church is infallible by that, as the whole man ſeeth by his eyes, toucheth by his hands. Neither can I deny, but that the Author well excepteth, or aſſumeth, that there is no leſſe neceſſity, the Church ſhould be known to be infallible, or which is this Church, then that there is one. For if I ſhould admit abſolutely, that it is neceſſary for every man to know the Church is Infallible, precedently to the knowledge of which is the true Church, I ſhould
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:165888:40"/>forget what I had before ſaid, that ſatisfaction is to be given to every one, according to his capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. It is ſufficient for a Childe to beleeve his Parents, for a Clown to beleeve his Preacher, about the Churches Infallibility. For Faith is given to mankind, to be a meanes to him of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, and living like a Chriſtian: and ſo he hath this ſecond, it is not much matter in what termes he be with the firſt. The good women and Clownes in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> trouble not themſelves to ſeek the grounds of their faith, but with a Chriſtian ſimplicity, ſeek to live according unto that their Preachers tell them; and without queſtion, by perſeverance, come to the happineſſe, great Clearks by too much ſpeculation may faile of. Such therefore know no otherwiſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church, then becauſe ſhe telleth it them, to whom they give credit, as innocently as any child to his Mother.</p>
               <p>The Church therefore was made infallible, becauſe ſo it was fitting for her Maker, ſo it was fitting for her ſelfe, ſo it was fit for that part of mankind, that had more refined wits; not becauſe it was neceſſary for every one which was to come to her, or live in her, whereof the greateſt part firſt commeth to her, drawn by ſome of the meanes before delivered, and beleeveth her about her infallibility.</p>
               <p>Neither doe I remit him to a generall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant tradition, as if himſelfe ſhould climbe up every age by learned Writers, and find it in every one. I take it to be impoſſible. Teſtimonies
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:165888:41"/>one may find in many ages, but ſuch as will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate and convince, a full tradition, I much doubt. Neither doe I find by experience, that who will draw a man by a rope or chain, giveth him the whole rope or chaine into his hands, but onely one end of it, unto which if he cleave hard, he ſhall be drawn which way the rope is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Tradition is a long chaine, every generation or delivery from father to ſonne, being a link in it. I ſend him therefore no further then to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age, where he ſhall (beyond all doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) find that this doctrine was delivered unto this age, by the care of their Anceſtors. And if we ſeek upon what termes, we find, that upon a fixed opinion of damnation in failing; and ſo, that they had received it ſo from their fore-fathers upon the ſame termes, with opinion that it had continued ever ſince Chriſt his time by this meanes. And he who is able to look into the meanes, how this can remaine conſtantly ſo many ages, may find it not onely the far ſecurer, but an evidently infallible ſucceſſion of doctrine, invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable as long as there is a Church. And this doth not onely ſhew that there is one, but which ſhe is, and that there can be no other. For I ſuppoſe, no man will be ſo ſenſeleſſe as to ſay, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles preached one thing in one part, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in another: wherefore it will be agreed, that once the Church agreed in her faith. This ſuppoſed, let us ſet the time when one part chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and will it not be evident, that the changing Church being challenged cannot plead, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:165888:41"/>it from her Anceſtors, becauſe it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly falſe to both parties? Then muſt needs one onely Church remain with that claime. And although we did not know what the <hi>Greek</hi> Church doth by her Hiſtory, yet the force of conſequence would tell us, they cannot doe this which the Weſterne Church doth, becauſe the doing of one is incompatible with the doing of the ſame by the other.</p>
               <p>As for the two places concerning the Popes and Councels infallibility, it is not to my purpoſe to medle of them, becauſe on the one ſide, the way I have begun, there is no need of thoſe diſcourſes; and on the other, I ſhould engage my ſelfe in quarrels betwixt Catholique, and Catholique, obſcure the matter I have taken in hand, and profit nothing in my hearers, more then to be judged, peradventure to have more learning then wiſedome to governe it withall. Wherefore I ſhall omit thoſe Paragraphes, if I onely note concerning the tradition impoſed upon <hi>Papius,</hi> that the very narration of it, ſheweth that it is no tradition, in the ſence we ſpeak of tradition, but in the ſence ſome Heretiques have pretended tradition; as it were a doctrine ſecretly delivered, and gathered out of private conference with the Apoſtles, and not their publique preaching delivered to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which is the way we exalt tradition in. The witneſſes alſo of ancient Fathers are no parts of tradition, but ſignes and markes where it hath paſſed, whereas the body of tradition is in the life and beleife of the whole Church. For the Church
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:165888:42"/>(as I have ſaid) is an eſſence compoſed, as it were, of interne and externe parts; the interne being faith, the externe, the outward action, which muſt needs be conformable to the internall faith, nor can there be a materiall change in the action, but it muſt argue the internall change of faith, nor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall change in faith, but it muſt draw with it an Iliad of altered actions.</p>
               <p>As for the place of <hi>Fevardentius,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth many Fathers to have fallen into errors, I thinke it will not trouble him, who is acquainted with the courſe of the preſent Church, wherein divers, who be thought great Divines, fall into errors, for which their bookes ſometimes are hindred from the print, ſometimes, recalled, or ſome leaves commanded to be paſted up. The reaſon is, the multiplicity of Catholique doctrine, which doth not oblige a man to the knowledge of every part, but to the prompt ſubjection, to the inſtruction of the Church, wherefore many men may hold falſe doctrine inculpably, not knowing it to be ſuch, even now after the learned labours of ſo many, that have ſtrived to open and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate by method, what is true and what is falſe; much more in the Fathers times, when there was great want of ſo many compilers, as theſe latter ages have produced.</p>
               <p>As for the two points, he ſaith, avert him from Catholique doctrine, I am miſtaken, if he be not miſtaken in both. The firſt is, that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique doctrine damnes all, who are not in the union of their Church. He thinketh the ſentence hard,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:165888:42"/>yet, I thinke he will not deny me this, that if any Church does not ſay ſo, it cannot be the true Church: For call the Church what you will, the Congregation of the Elect, the Congregation of the Faithfull, the Congregation of Saints, or Juſt; call it, I ſay, or define it what you will, doth it not clearly follow, that whoſoever is out of that Church cannot be ſaved; for he ſhall not be Elect, Juſt, Faithfull, &amp;c. without which there is no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. How then can any Church maintaine theſe two propoſitions? I am the true Church, and yet one may be ſaved, without being in me. But peradventure he is ſcandalized, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church requireth actuall communion, externall with her, which he thinketh in ſome caſe may be wanting, without detriment of Salvation. But how would he have the Church ſpeake, which ſpeaketh in common, but abſtracting from ſuch particular caſes, as may change wholly the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the queſtion. For example ſake; hath not the Church reaſon to ſay, he that denyeth the bleſſed Trinity is an Heretique? It hapneth, one who hath converſed among the <hi>Tritheites,</hi> hearing them uſe the word Trinity for three Gods, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpeak againſt them, denyeth there is any Trinity; ſhall this man be comprehended in the foreſaid condemnation? Or was the ſentence ill pronounced? Neither, as I think. For bo h was it well done by the Church, to condemne denyers of the Trinity, becauſe <hi>per ſe loquendo</hi> (as the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſpeak) that is, according to the ordinary courſe, and nature of things, who denyeth a thing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:165888:43"/>in words, denyeth it in heart; yet the man fore-ſpoken, did not ſo, and was not condemned in that ſentence. In like manner, when the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth all ſuch as are not in actuall union, and communion with her, ſhe doth well: becauſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary courſe, this doth not fall out, without either preſumption, and damnable pride, or elſe culpable, either ignorance, or feare, and love of private intereſt, before God and his Church. But it followeth not thence, that by accident no man may ſometime be excuſed. The words of our Saviour concerning Baptiſme and Euchariſt their neceſſity, are very preciſe, yet the Church doubteth not to excuſe thoſe who have it in <hi>voto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed unto the point. The corrent of Catholique Doctors holdeth, that no man ſhall be damned for infidelity, but he who wilfully doth miſ-beleeve, and that to doe ſo, it is required that faith be ſufficiently propoſed unto him. And what is to be ſufficiently propoſed, is not determined amongſt them. There wanteth not Divines, that teach, that even <hi>ignorantia affectata,</hi> doth excuſe from Heriſie.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide it is moſt certaine, that no man is damned for not profeſſing, what he is not damned for not beleeving. Wherefore profeſſion being that which engrafteth a man exteriorly in the Church of God, according unto the ordinary opinions of Catholiques; it followeth, that no man is condemned for not being of the Church, who is not for infidelity, for which it is a very
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:165888:43"/>uncertaine caſe, who be damned and who not. So that the Catholique poſition is not ſo crude, as peradventure the Author underſtood it to be, though the words be rough, and ought to be ſo, as being of what is according to the courſe of nature, not what chance and accidents may invent.</p>
               <p>The other point was of puting Heretiques to death, which I think he underſtandeth to be done Vindicatively, not Medicinally. I meane impoſed as a puniſhment, and not in way to prevent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife, or oppreſſe it in the head. If the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellians</hi> were the firſt, that is ancient enough for the juſtification of the fact, although for baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which alſo he ſeemeth to reprehend) we know the firſt that could ſuffer it, did ſuffer it. <hi>Arrius,</hi> I meane, by the hand of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> whom he praiſeth for a ſpeech he uttered, before he knew the conſequence of the danger, and ſeemeth to reprehend for his after and better wits. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> juſtifieth ſuch proceeding againſt Here tiques. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> adviſed the like againſt <hi>Pagans,</hi> (if I remember) and the Church laterly, hath rather increaſed then decreaſed in the practiſe of it. <hi>Mores</hi>'s ſpeech, I beleeve is miſtaken, the force of it being, that the baniſhment of Biſhops ſhewed his faith, becauſe the baniſhed were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, which ſhewed <hi>Lucius</hi> to be none. But what can be ſaid, if the Church uſeth that for the prevention of a greater, and more dangerous evill, which all politique Eſtates uſe for the remedies of leſſe, and leſſe dangerous evils, and are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for it? For if Faith be the way of Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:165888:44"/>and hereby the bane of Faith; if Salvation be the greateſt good, then the danger of a Countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over runne with Hereſie, is the greateſt of dangers, greater then the multiplying of Theeves, greater then the unſurety of the wayes, greater then a Plague, or Invaſion. Why then doth not reaſon force us to uſe the meanes to prevent it, which the ſame reaſon and experience, teacheth us to be moſt efficacious in this, and all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious and gangrening maladies of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. I hope reaſon it ſelfe, and the zeale of the Author to his own and Countries Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will ſupply my ſhortneſſe in this point. For ſuppoſing a Church be aſſured ſhe is in the right, and that the doctrine preached by another, leadeth to damnation, I know not why <hi>Caipha's</hi> words ſhould not be propheticall in this caſe, and that truly it doth not <hi>expedire,</hi> that <hi>unus mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatur pro populo, &amp; non tota gens pereat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He urgeth afterwards againſt the unity of the Church, that it is none ſuch as we brag off. And I confeſſe we brag of it, and thinke we have reaſon too. And if it pleaſe him to look into the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of our Country of <hi>England,</hi> and ſome Land of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> as <hi>Braſile,</hi> or ſuch other, where they live without Law or Government. I thinke he will find, that our bragging is not without ground. For wherein is the difference betwixt a civill Government, and a barbarous Anarchie? Is it either, that in a civill Eſtate there be no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, or amongſt <hi>Barbarians</hi> there is no quiet. The former would prejudice our Courts and Juſtice,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:165888:44"/>the latter is impoſſible, even in nature. What is then the goodneſſe of Government, but that in a well govern'd Country, there is a meanes to end quarrels, and in an Anarchy there can be no aſſured peace? This therefore is that we brag of, that amongſt us, if any controverſie riſe, there is a way to end it, which is not amongſt them who part from us. And ſecondly, that there is no aſſured agreement amongſt thoſe who are parted from us; for although to day they agree, there is no bond, nor tye, why to morrow they may not diſagree. Theſe two things we brag of, and I think the Author will not deny it. For he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth we all agree, in that the Church is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Miſtreſſe. Then it is evident, that if in any controverſie ſhe interpoſeth her judgement, the controverſie is ended. He likewiſe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that who part from us, have no ſuch defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive authority amongſt them, and that Scripture whereon they relie, hath not this vertue, to take up controverſies clearly. Againe, I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, moſt Engliſh men confeſſe a Trinity, the Incarnation, and Paſſion of our Saviour, but if to morrow, any one or more of them, light upon ſome book of an <hi>Arrian, Trinitarian,</hi> or other Sect, ſo wittily written, that he putteth probable ſolutions for the places of Scriptures, ſheweth ſlight wayes, how our well-meaning fore-fathers may have ſlipped into ſuch an error; what is there to retaine theſe men, from diſagreeing with the reſt of their brethern, and betake themſelves to the <hi>Arrians:</hi> And when the heat is paſſed,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:165888:45"/>light upon ſome Rabbi, who ſhall cunningly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerate the abſurdities (as he ſhall terme them) of the Trinity, Incarnation, Paſſion; ſay our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did ſtrange things in vertue of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation, and delivering theſe things ſo oratori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, that for a new heat theſe things ſhall ſeem more conformable, then his <hi>Arrianiſme;</hi> what then ſhall hinder this to become a <hi>Jew,</hi> and at laſt to prove himſelfe ſo great a Clerk, as to write <hi>De Tribus Impoſtoribus.</hi> Take away the power of the Church (which every man doth, who taketh away the Infallibility) what can retaine any man, why he ſhould not yeeld to that diſcourſe, which ſeemeth faireſt, ſeeing nothing is certaine? But peradventure, ſome may attribute power unto the Church without Infallibility, whom I would have conſider, but what himſelfe ſaith. For his Church, by the power it hath, muſt either ſay, I command you to beleeve me, or I command you to profeſſe this, whether you beleeve me or no. The ſecond I think, no enemy of equivocation will admit, as the former is as much, as if it ſhould ſay, I know not whether I ſay true or no, yet you muſt think I ſay true. So that if I underſtand any thing, where there is no Infallibility, there is no Power, where no Power, no Unity, where no Unity, no Entity, no Church. Now for the controverſies mentioned (beſides that, there is a meanes to terminate them) they be ſuch, as bring no breach of the ancient life, and action of Chriſtians, which all thoſe Opinions doe, which for the moſt part are reputed to make Heretiques; That ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:165888:45"/>amongſt us are not reſolved, is a thing neceſſary amongſt humane affaires, where things muſt have a time to be borne, to encreaſe, to fall; and the greater things are, the greater is their period. Wherefore I doe not ſee, why this may hurt the Church, more then the Suits which hang in our Courts, prejudice the Government of the Land. Neither can any other Church aſſume Infallibility to it ſelfe; becauſe it cannot lay hold of this principle, that it receiveth its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by hands; and ſo muſt firſt profeſſe the Church of Chriſt to be fallible, or elſe it cannot part from it.</p>
               <p>The laſt point of the Authors diſcourſe, is, to ſhew how errors might have crept in. Wherein I ſhall have no oppoſition with him, for I doe not thinke the queſtion is, how they ſhould creep in, but how they ſhould be kept out? For the fluxibility of humane nature is ſo great, that it is no wonder if errors ſhould have crept in, the wayes being ſo many, but it is a great wonder of God, that none ſhould have crept in. This nevertheleſſe I may ſay, (if the Author will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, (as I think) he will not deny, but that it is diſputable, whether any error in ſixteen ages hath crept in) this very thing is above nature. For if there were not an excellency beyond the nature of corruptible things, it would be undeniably e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that not one or two, but hundreds of errors had quite changed the ſhape of the Church in ſo many yeares, tempeſts, diviſions, want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce in the body of the Church. But this one
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:165888:46"/>maxime, that ſhe receiveth her Faith by Tradition, and not from Doctors, hath ever kept her entire. And he that will ſhew the contrary, muſt ſhew how it could come to paſſe, that thoſe who lived in ſuch an age, could ſay unto their children, this we received from our fore-fathers, as taught them by their fore-fathers, to have been received from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, from hand to hand; which if it could not be, the queſtion is reſolved, that no error is in the Church of God, which hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth her faith upon that tenure.</p>
               <p>And truly, if the Author deſire to examine many Religions, let him look their main ground wherein they relye, and ſee whether that be good or no. And I thinke amongſt Chriſtians he ſhall find but two, Tradition, and Scripture. And the Catholique onely to relye upon Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and all the reſt upon Scripture. And alſo ſhall he ſee, that relying upon Scripture cannot draw to an unity, thoſe who relye upon it; and that more then one cannot relye upon Tradition, which when I have conſidered, I have no further to ſeeke, for if I will be a Chriſtian, I muſt belong to one ſide. By falling on the one ſide, I ſee my fortune in thouſands who have gone before me, to wit, that I ſhall be to ſeek all my life time, as I ſee they are, and how greatly they magnifie very weak peices. On the other ſide, I ſee every man who followeth it, as far as he follow it, is at quiet; and therefore cannot chuſe, but think there to be the ſtone to reſt my head upon, againſt which <hi>Jacob</hi> his Ladder is reared unto Heaven.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:165888:46"/>
               <p>The Author hath through his whole diſcourſe, inſerted divers things, which ſeem particularly to the juſtification of himſelfe, in the way of his ſearch. The which, as I think, on one ſide I ſhould be too blame to exaimine (for who am I, to judge the Servant of another man) ſo, becauſe I cannot think, but that they were inſerted for love of truth, and to heare what might be ſaid againſt them (craving pardon, if on preſumption of that, it is his will, I anyway offend) I ſhall touch the matter, wholly abſtracting from the perſonall diſpoſition of any man. And to begin a far of, it is confeſſed amongſt Catholiques, that all ſinne muſt be wilfull, and ſo as far as any mans doubt in Religion is not by will, but by force and neceſſity, ſo far it is not culpable, but may be laudable before God and man. As was without doubt the anxious ſearch of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> for the truth, which he relateth in his confeſſions, for who is aſſured of being out of the truth, muſt have time to ſeek it, and ſo long this doubt is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, and laudable. That which muſt juſtifie this ſearch, is in common, that which juſtifieth all actions, that a man be ſure in the aime he aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at, and in the meanes he taketh, not to be governed by any paſſion, intereſt, or wilfulneſſe, but that he ſincerely aimeth, and carefully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth in the ſearch of the truth it ſelfe, for the love of it; and of thoſe goods which depend of the knowledge of it. This is a thing, in which a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall man can have no other judge then himſelfe; for no man knoweth what is within a man, but
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:165888:47"/>the Spirit, or conſcience of man. But he himſelfe muſt be a rigorous Judge unto himſelfe, for it is very hard to know the truth: when I ſay rigorous, I mean exact, and fearfull miſ-deeming: As holy <hi>Job</hi> was, who ſaid, <hi>He was fearfull of all his actions.</hi> Holy <hi>David,</hi> but amongſt all, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth more ſweetly complaine of the miſery of man, not knowing his own diſpoſitions, and yet he was then forty yeares of age, when paſſions and heates of youth which make this diſcuſſion harder, are generally ſettled. Beſides this, he muſt have this care, that he ſeek what the nature of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject can yeeld, and not as thoſe Phyſitians, who when they have promiſed no leſſe then immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, can at laſt onely reach to ſome conſervation of health, or youth, in ſome ſmall degree. So I could wiſh the Author, to well aſſure himſelfe firſt, that there is poſſible, an Infallibility, before he be too earneſt, to be contented with nothing leſſe. For what if humane nature ſhould not be capable of ſo great a good, would he therefore think fitting to live without any Religion, becauſe he could not get ſuch a one as himſelfe deſired, though with more then a mans wiſh. Were it not rationall to ſee, whether amongſt Religions, ſome one hath not ſuch notable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages over the reſt, as in reaſon it might ſeeme, humane nature might be contented withall Let him caſt his accompts with the deareſt things he hath, his own, or freinds lives, his eſtate, his hope of poſterity, and ſee upon what termes of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he is ready to venture all theſe, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:165888:47"/>to Religion, and ſee whether, if he doe not venture his ſoule upon the like, it be truly reaſon, or ſome other not confeſſed motive, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth him. For my own part, as I doubt not of an Infallibity, ſo I doubt not, but ſetting that aſide, there be thoſe excellencies found on the Catholique party, which may force a man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it, and venture all he hath upon it, before all other Religions, and Sects in the world: Why then may not one, who after long ſearching fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no Infallibility, reſt himſelfe on the like, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing mans nature affordeth no better?</p>
               <p>Another thing may make a mans ſearch faulty, and is carefully to be looked unto, I meane, that it is eaſie for a man to miſtake himſelfe, by too much confidence in himſelfe or others. He that will make a judgement in an Art he is not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in, if he be deceived, is to impute it unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. The Phraſe commandeth us to beleeve every man in his Art; he who knoweth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth himſelfe, beleeveth not. Therefore when we ſee Maſters in an Art, we are not skilled in, oppoſe us, we may beleeve we are in the wrong: which will bred this reſolution in the Author of the diſcourſe, that if himſelfe be not skilled all thoſe wayes in which he purſueth his ſearch, he muſt find himſelfe obliged to ſeek Maſters, who be both well skilled, and (the matter being ſubject to faction) alſo very honeſt and upright men, or elſe he doth not quit himſelfe before God and man.</p>
               <p>I cannot part without one note more, which is, that it is not all one to incurre damnation for infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:165888:48"/>and to be in ſtate of Salvation. For the man to whom infidelity is not imputed, may be in ſtate of damnation, for other faults, as thoſe were who having known God by his works, did not glorifie him as they ought: nay, they may be damned through want of Faith, and yet not be condemned for incredulity. As for example ſake, if when they have ſinned, they know not what meanes to take to have them forgiven, though they be without fault in not beleeving, nevertheleſſe dying without remiſſion of ſinne, they are not in ſtate to come to life everlaſting. As the man, who ſhould venture into a Wood without a guide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he did his beſt to have a guide, nothing leſſe might fall out of his way, as well as he, who neglected the taking of one; ſo if God ſent his Sonne to ſhew us the way of Salvation, and that be but one; as well is he like not to be ſaved, who never heard of ſuch a way, as he that heard of it, and neglected it; for neither of the two goeth that way; and who goes not on the way, is not like to come to the end. I know God is good and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull; but I know his workes, as far as we know, are diſpenſed by the order of ſecond cauſes; and where we ſee no ſecond cauſes, we cannot preſume of the effects. God is good and mercifull I know, and feedeth the Birds of the aire, and much more men; yet we ſee in dearths and hard winters, both men and Birds to periſh, doe they what they could to get victuals. And how am I aſſured he will ſend Angels to illuminate ſuch men as doe their endeavours, that their ſoules may not periſh? But
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:165888:48"/>far more doe I doubt, whether ever man, who had not the way of Chriſt, or even of thoſe, who wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in it, did ever doe his beſt (except ſome few, and very few, perhaps not two of Chriſt his greateſt favourites) and was not ſo culpable, that his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would not have been imputed unto himſelfe. God of his mercy put us in the ſcore of thoſe, of whom he ſaith, <hi>He will take pitty upon whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and compaſsion of them he pleaſeth.</hi>

            <p>To begin then with your Treatiſe, you can ſay nothing for Tradition, which I will not willingly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:165888:51"/>allow, Scripture it ſelf being a <hi>Traditum,</hi> and by that way comming to our knowledge, (for I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that thoſe who would know it by the Spirit, run themſelves into the ſame Circle between Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Spirit, out of which ſome of your ſide have but unſucceſſefully laboured to get out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Scripture and Church) but that this way which you propound ſhould be convenient to know what was Tradition at firſt, I can by no means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Which to conſider the better, I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all the ſtrength of what you have ſaid in a little room, and ſhut up your Oration into the compaſſe of ſome 3. Sillogiſmes; thus you argue,</p>
            <p>What company ſoever of Chriſtians alone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to teach nothing but what they have received from their Fathers, as received from theirs, as ſo come down from the Apoſtles, that company a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone muſt hold the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But that company of Chriſtians which are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>only pretend this,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore they alone hold the truth, and the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> you prove thus:</p>
            <p>If ſuch a company of Chriſtians could teach falſhoods, then (ſince it is granted that what was at firſt delivered was true) ſome age muſt either have erred in underſtanding their Anceſtors, or have joyned to deceive their poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But neither of theſe are beleevable,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore neither is it beleevable, that ſuch a company of Chriſtians ſhould teach falſhoods.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> you prove thus; (I mean that they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:165888:52"/>alone pretend it, for that they, I mean all they, pretend it, you take for granted.)</p>
            <p>If it be incompatible with the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> doing it, that any elſe ſhould doe it, then ſhe does it alone.</p>
            <p>But it is incompatible,(which is denied, and not yet proved.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore ſhe doth it alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſeverall parts of this Argument, I mean firſt to Anſwer; and ſecondly, Whatſoever lyes ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in your diſcourſe any thing to this purpoſe, or any other unanſwer'd in the firſt part: and thirdly, I will reply to thoſe Anſwers which you have been pleaſed to make, to part of that Nothing which I writ, wiſhing that this laſt work might have bin longer, I mean that by anſwering it all, and in order, you had given me occaſion to have dwelt more upon my Reply.</p>
            <p>Now if I doe not ſhew that all of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do not, nor cannot pretend this, that for two to pretend it is not incompatible (as having been ſo heretofore) that thoſe who alone pretend this may pretend it falſely, that ſome men, and in time all may miſtake their Anceſtors, and have a mind in ſome caſes to deceive their poſterity, and that it is not neceſſary for a whole age at once to joyn in doing it, though it be done (if I ſay) I ſhew not this, then let me not bee beleeved, and if you can ſhew me that I have not ſhewed it, I will promiſe to beleeve you.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not, nor cannot pretend, that all their doctrine was received
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:165888:52"/>by them from their fathers as come down from the Apoſtles, it appeares, becauſe when queſtions have riſen about ſuch things, whereof there was before no ſpeech, yet if a Councell have determined them, they are received with the ſame aſſent, as if they had come from the Apoſtles; and they profeſſe now the ſame readineſſe to receive alwayes any ſuch definition, though about a queſtion now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; and it is likely, they have done what they profeſſe they are ready to doe; at leaſt, they ſhew, that yours is not the ground upon which they build. And I pray aske your ſelfe, whether thoſe that teach the common people (who are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of your Church) uſe to be askt about it by them, or uſe to tell them, that this they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from their Fathers, as deſcended from the Apoſtles, by a continuall verball Tradition. For ſuppoſe they told them, that [this Tradition tels us] yet they are not able to diſtinguiſh between ſuch as is but Eccleſiaſticall, and Apoſtolicall, or whether this be known to them onely by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, or from ancient bookes, and no ſuch uncontinued line of teaching, and not rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them in generall to beleeve it, what by Arguments drawne from Scripture, what from reaſon, what from Fathers, Councels, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals? I am not certaine what is their courſe, but I am ſure, the moſt ordinary amongſt the Ancients (whom they pretend to follow) was, that when they had told the people, that ſuch a propoſition was true, they added [neither is it I that ſay ſo, but the Apoſtle, the Prophet, or
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:165888:53"/>the Evangeliſt] and mentioned the place, where they thought ſuch a doctrine was included, ſeldome ſpeak of any verball Tradition (leſſe of ſuch a one, upon which you wholly rely) except urg'd to it, when that was impudently claim'd by ſome Heretique; and when they did (as the <hi>Aſian</hi> Biſhops about <hi>Eaſter, Juſtin Martir</hi> about the age of Chriſt, Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> about commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating Infants, <hi>Papius</hi> and <hi>Iraeneus</hi> about the doctrine of the <hi>Chiliaſts</hi>) then (as <hi>Lucian</hi> tels us, that when that Jugler <hi>Alexander</hi> ſent to a City a Verſe to be ſet upon their doores to keepe away the Plague, thoſe houſes which uſed the remedy, were more viſited then thoſe that did not ſo) thoſe doctrines which the Fathers did grace by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting verball Tradition in their foreheads, were not leſſe (perhaps more) apt to be after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeved, then the other which were not in that kind taught.</p>
            <p>Now if the Ignorant be not expreſly inſtructed, that upon this ground they are to think that true, which they are bid to beleeve (eſpecially where their religion is eaſily enough received, onely for being that of their Country) you muſt allow, that the greateſt part of your Church cannot, nor does not pretend, to have received all they beleeve under that Notion; and to know they did, you muſt have ſpoke with them all, or have heard them all inſtructed; for what is in ſome places ſo taught, may be delivered upon other grounds in the very next Pariſhes.</p>
            <p>From the Ignorant let'us come to the learned,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:165888:53"/>and ſee whether they doe not both beleeve more, and require more to be beleeved, then hath had any ſuch pedigree as you imagine. Firſt, then the great, eloquent, and judicious Cardinall <hi>Perron,</hi> (whom I preferre ſo much before all thoſe of his ſide that have been Authors, that [if a Pigmy may be allowed to meaſure Giants] I ſhould think that the vaſt learning and induſtry of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> might with moſt advantage to their party, and no diſgrace to them, have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in ſeeking quotations for his large and monſtrous underſtanding to have employ'd them) he, I ſay, tels us, (and not from himſelfe, but from Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi>) that the Trinity, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Free-will, and the Church, were never exactly diſputed of, before the <hi>Arrians,</hi> the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians,</hi> the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> Now (ſince without doubt the former ages diſputed as well as they could, and ſo could not inſtruct their Proſelites, better then they confuted their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries) I think it evident, that more hath ſince been concluded, then came from Tradition, and that the way you ſpeak of, appeared not ſufficient, either to Cardinall <hi>Perron,</hi> or Saint <hi>Auſtin.</hi> But becauſe <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (being written in a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall language) is more generally (though, I thinke unjuſtly) eſteemed then <hi>Perron,</hi> I will aske you a queſtion of him, when he excuſeth Pope <hi>John</hi> the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. for denying, that Saints enjoy the beatificall viſion before the day of judgement (in which he was lead by a Troop of Fathers) becauſe the Church had not then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:165888:54"/>the contrary; did <hi>Bellarmine</hi> beleeve, that then Chriſtians had received from their Fathers, as from the Apoſtles, a direct contrary Tradition to his doctrine? If he did, how could he think the Pope, either poſſibly to be ignorant of it, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeable, it he ſtood againſt it? If not, then he thought our Age beholding to our Fathers, for finding out ſome truths, which had no ſuch line to come down by; nay, which the Apoſtles either taught not, or but obſcurely, and ſo as needs Arguments to deduce it out of their writings; at leaſt, not ſo generally, but that a Pope, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more chiefe Doctors of the Church, knew not they had done ſo, (although you often put us in minde, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> tels us, how in that Church which he governed, the Apoſtles poured out all their doctrines with their blood) and in his time, Fathers taught not their children ſo: And this objection lyes againſt you, as often as any of your ſide confeſſe any of the Ancients (accompted Orthodox) to have delivered any doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of the now Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which many of them often confeſſe, and your ſelfe doe not deny: for that they could not have done, if an uninterrupted verball Tradition had been then the onely rule of true doctrine, and they had known it to be ſo (for then they had a way of information, which you muſt confeſſ eaſie, ſince they might ſoon have known, whether generally, Chriſtians had been taught the contrary, under ſuch a Notion, and in ſuch a degree, as you ſpeak of) or the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had not ſince, either
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:165888:54"/>deviated from the tradition of one part, or intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced on the other.</p>
            <p>But becauſe you knew, that the claime of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition could not ſerve your Churches turne, if any other different from yours made the ſame; you therefore affirme, that none doth, and prove it, becauſe two cannot doe it; and in this you muſt give me leave to ſay, that you imitate the Philoſopher, who made Arguments againſt Motion, though one walked before him; for though we ſee that the <hi>Greek</hi> Church does it as much as the <hi>Romane,</hi> (though apt to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the doing it, by the ſame wayes) yet you hope to perſwade us beyond our eyes, by a reaſon, which indeed ends in an aſſertion: for, I pray, why may not two companies of Chriſtians, both pretend to ſuch a Tradition, (though oppoſing each other) as well as the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches and the <hi>Roman</hi> did long together, about the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Eaſter?</hi> But not onely that it may be ſo, but that it is ſo, you may find by <hi>Hieremy, Nilus,</hi> and <hi>Barlaam</hi> (who profeſſe to ſtand to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, the ancient Tradition of their Fathers, and the ſeven firſt generall Councels, and they can be diſprov'd no way, but by the ſame you may be ſo too) over and above the confeſſions of your own men.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe you did pretend, and alone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſuch a Tradition, yet you might falſely doe it: for I deſire you to remember, that the Apoſtles delivered, as well Writings as verball Doctrine; and whatſoever the firſt ages thought
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:165888:55"/>to be contained there, that they might as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to their poſterity, as taught them by the Apoſtles, as what they received by word of mouth; ſince we uſe to ſay, I learnt this of ſuch a man, when we mean from his book, and though you ſtrive to joyne verball Tradition in commiſſion with Scripture, yet ſure none of you can deſire to thruſt Scripture out quite from being at leaſt a part of the Rule. Now that they might erre in interpreting their writings (and an error in the cheifeſt then, might eaſily cauſe a generall one ſince) I think you will not deny, eſpecially ſince to ſay, that they left by Tradition every place of Scripture interpreted, would be an evidently falſe aſſertion: for how could the Fathers then have written upon it ſuch differently-expounding Comments.</p>
            <p>Secondly, How ſhall it appeare, that there were not once two contrary Traditions claimed by two Parts (as the <hi>Aſian</hi> Church, and the <hi>Roman,</hi> whereof, both it ſeemes claim'd a direct verball Tradition, becauſe one pretended to have received theirs from Saint <hi>John,</hi> and the other, from Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> whereof there is no word in their workes) and that the erring Part did not prevaile? We know, out of the fifth of <hi>Euſebius</hi> Hiſtory, that the fore-runners laid claime to Tradition, and nam'd the very Pope, that had chang'd the doctrine at <hi>Rome;</hi> which claime (how impudently ſoever) yet ſhewes, that men might joyne to deceive their Poſterity, as pretending to a Tradition, when there was no ſuch; for, if
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:165888:55"/>you ſay thoſe were but few, I anſwer, both that you are not certaine of their number, and ſince ſo many may joyn, I pray, what number is it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Since you muſt and doe confeſſe, that ſome Doctrines, which were not once ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally witneſſed to have been delivered by the Apoſtles, are now Doctrines of Faith (as the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> was rejected by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>'s time, though to her yee uſe to ſay, that <hi>Iraeneus</hi> would have every Church agree, and though Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> whom you would prove to have thought <hi>Damaſus</hi> infallible, when it is known, that he thought <hi>Libertius</hi> a Heretick, received it for all that) becauſe you ſay, that theſe doctrines had ſo much Tradition as was <hi>exceptione major,</hi> beyond exception, (though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> thought not ſo then;) doth not this reſt upon the Logick of thoſe Ages, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude what Teſtimony is ſo? which might eaſily deceive them, eſpecially ſince you confeſſe alſo, that particular Traditions may be falſe (as you inſtance in the <hi>Chiliaſts</hi>) and yet the ſame reaſon, which perſwaded ſome to receive them, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade more and more in ſeverall times (and ſo no age need to joyne, as you ſuppoſe) and ſo a falſe Tradition may grow a generall one; as it ſeemes that of the <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> (if it be one) did, ſo generall, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſayes, in his time all Orthodox Chriſtians held it.</p>
            <p>Beſides, in thoſe things which were beleeved very convenient, and which yet it was fear'd, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:165888:56"/>unleſſe men thought them neceſſary, they would be backward to practiſe, in reſpect of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of them to their diſpoſitions, (as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) how eaſie was it for them to be after taught, under paine of more danger, then at firſt they were delivered, with? as Phyſitians often tell their Patients, unleſſe they take ſuch a Potion, from which they are very averſe, they muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably die, though the not taking of it (even in their own opinions) would but make them leſſe likely to recover. Some of great authority (moved by a good meaning) might thus deceive others; theſe, thus deceived, might deceive others; till, being generally ſpread, other good men, being loath to oppoſe them for the ſame reaſon, for which others deſir'd to ſpread them, (as we ſaw <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who beleeved your confeſſion, not to have been inſtituted by the Apoſtles, yet would not reprehend them that ſaid ſo, thinking it an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that would increaſe Piety) they be at laſt taken to have been commanded by the Apoſtles, without contradiction.</p>
            <p>Indeed all the waies, by which I ſhewd in that paper, which you vouchſafed to anſwer (which I deſire not to repeat, to avoid both your being wearied, and my own, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>You may ſee then that all your Church goes not upon your grounds, ſince if they did ſo, many of it that ſtand for the Affirmative muſt pretend to them, and if they doe, then ſure the Pope muſt have confeſſed them to be witneſſes beyond excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and would accordingly have defin'd, if they doe not, then this certain way of yours, cannot keep falſe opinions out of a Church, which makes not that their Rule.</p>
            <p>You may alſo ſee that opinions firſt unknown, after but particular, may come not onely to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and to have Tradition claim'd for them, but even to be defin'd; ſince if a Generall Councell ſhould now meet about this point, it is plain (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods immediate working to the contrary, of nay, I am confident, that as it is obſerved of the

               <hi>Romans</hi> that they were twice as long in firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering <hi>Italy,</hi> as (after) all the world; and as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> tels us of one, who was wont to ſay, <hi>That he had firſt with much paines gotten a little eſtate, and after with little a great one;</hi> ſo it is a much more ſhort, and eaſie work to bring this to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, then it was before to bring it thus far on the way towards one.</p>

            <p>And indeed the current of Writers of your own ſide either knew not this opinion and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of yours, or conſideringly balk it; elſe they might ſave themſelves and their Readers the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of writing, and reading ſuch infinite Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: for though they ſpeak often of Tradition, yet they thinke themſelves bound to prove it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then by the pretence of your preſent Church; they pretend to receive it from the Ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:165888:58"/>(not, ſay they, that Verball Tradition hath in all Ages been taught to all men, to teach it their children, and that it never ſlept,) and you are the firſt whom I have met with, who build upon this; Indeed they know the Greeks have as much claim to ſuch a one (in truth to any) as they, and if they ſhould ſay with you, that it is incompatible for two to have it, the Greeks may as well argue upon thoſe grounds, that the <hi>Romans</hi> claim it not, becauſe they doe, as the <hi>Romans</hi> can, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> lay no claim to it, becauſe their Church does.

            <p>Firſt then, that the <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> are Hereticks, or your Church not infallible, which counts them ſo, is moſt certaine, and moſt plaine, and if you be in the right, and that ſhe teacheth nothing, but what ſhe hath received uninterruptedly downe from the Apoſtles, then they muſt alwaies have been eſteemed ſo by Chriſtians; whereas their doctrine is ſo farre from having any Tradition againſt it, that if anie opinion, whether contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, or uncontroverted (except that Scripture which never was doubted) may without bluſhing pretend to have that for it, it muſt be this of theirs. My Reaſons are theſe:</p>
            <p>The Fathers of the pureſt Ages (who were the Apoſtles Diſciples but once remov'd) did teach this, [as receiv'd from them, who profeſſed to have receiv'd it from the Apoſtles, and who ſeem'd to them witneſſes beyond exception, that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:165888:60"/>they had done ſo, they being better Judges what credit they deſerv'd, then after commers could poſſibly be.</p>
            <p>All other opinions, witneſſed by any other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients to have Tradition, may have been by them miſtaken to have been, ſo, out of Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s and <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s rules: whereas for this, and for this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, are delivered the very words, which Chriſt us'd when he taught it.</p>
            <p>Of the moſt glorious and leaſt infirme buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which ever in my opinion was erected to the honour of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> was the Architect (I mean his book againſt King <hi>James</hi>) and that relies upon theſe two pillars, that whatſoever all the Fathers (he meanes, ſure, that are extant) witneſſe to be Tradition, and the doctrine of the Church, that muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd for the doctrine of thoſe ages, and ſo reſted upon: If theſe rules be not concluding, then the whole book being built upon them, neceſſarily becomes as unconſiderable for what he intended it, as <hi>Bevis</hi> or <hi>Tom Thumb:</hi> If they be, then this doctrine, which is now hereticall in your Churches beleife was the opinion of the Ancient Church. For if being taught by the Fathers of anie Age, none contradicting it, be ſufficient, this all for above two Ages (and thoſe the firſt) teach, not anie Father oppoſing it before <hi>Dionyſius Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> (250, yeares after Chriſt at leaſt) that we know, or Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> or Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> knew and quoted; wherein I note, beſides, that both theſe Fathers, either thought that no ſigne of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:165888:60"/>opinion of the Church, or cared not though it were.</p>
            <p>And if Fathers ſpeaking as witneſſes will ſerve, let <hi>Pappias</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> be heard, and believ'd, who tels us it came to them from Chriſt by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball Tradition, and <hi>Juſtine Martir,</hi> who witneſſeth that in his time all Orthodoxe Chriſtians held it, and joynes the oppoſers with them who denied the Reſurrection, and eſteemes them among the Chriſtians like the <hi>Sadduces</hi> among the <hi>Jewes:</hi> which proves that you have the ſame reaſon <hi>expal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcere audito Eccleſiae nomine,</hi> to grow pale at the mention of the Ancient Church,<note place="margin">Camp.</note> (the neareſt to the Apoſtles) as we have to ſtart at that of two hundred years agoe, and to be aſham'd of your <hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus,</hi> as wee of <hi>Luther:</hi> Thus that great <hi>Atlas</hi> of your Church hath helpt us to pull it down the ſame waies, by which he intended to ſupport it, and though he have beſt of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the burden of proving that to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which is falſe, yet he muſt have confeſt, that either theſe are not proofes, or they prove againſt himſelf. And this advantage we have, that unleſſe you prove your own infallibility (which you will never be able to do) in what point ſoever you confute us, that falls like a Pinacle without carrying all after it; whereas if we diſprove any one of your Religion, we diſprove conſequently that infallibility, which is the foundation of it all: ſo that (like them who vſe poiſon'd weapons) whereſoever we wound, we kill, but we are like thoſe creatures, which muſt be killed all over, or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:165888:61"/>elſe their other parts will remaine alive.</p>
            <p>Neither muſt you think that you have anſwer'd the <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> by tying them to the <hi>Carpocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> and the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> (which is but like <hi>Mezen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his joyning <hi>Mortua corpora vivis,</hi> dead bodies to the living) ſince the opinions of the two latter, aſſoon as they were taught, made the teachers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Hereticks and were oppos'd by allmoſt all, whereas that of the firſt, found in above two ages, no reſiſtance by any one known and eſteemed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the teachers of it were not onely parts, but principall ones of the Catholique Church, and ſuch as ever have been, and are reputed Saints; though, by I know not what ſubtlety you diſpence with your ſelves for departing from what doctrine was received from them as come down from the Apoſtles, and yet threaten us with damnation if we will not believe more improbable Tenets to be Tradition upon leſſe Certificate.

Neither can I find out what it is by which you conclude, that their Tradition was gathered the Hereticall way from private diſcourſe with the Apoſtles: <hi>Irenaeus</hi> indeed tells us, that <hi>Presbyteri meminerunt,</hi> one of which <hi>Pappias</hi> was, but not a word that it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:165888:61"/>was deliver'd in ſecret, or the auditors but few, nor that others had not heard other diſciples teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame doctrine; and me thinkes that if you had evinced what you deſire (as you ſeem to me not to do, unleſſe to affirm be to prove) it would make more againſt you; ſure if from ſo ſmall a ground as the word of one onely diſciple, that he in private diſcourſe was taught this by the Apoſtles, a falſe doctrine could ſo generally be received by all the firſt Doctors of the Chriſtian Church, and that ſo long after <hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus</hi> had uſed his great Authority to deſtroy it: Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> was yet halfe afraid to write againſt it, as ſeeing how many Catholiques he ſhould enrage againſt himſelfe by it, as he teſtifies in his Proem to the eighteenth Book of his Comment upon <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> what ſuſpitions muſt this raiſe in the mindes of thoſe of your own party, leaſt what they eſteemed Tradition, had at firſt no greater a beginning, and no firmer foundation, but onely better fortune; for why might not the ſame diſciple have cozn'd them from whom their beliefe is deſcended in twenty other things, as well as in this? and why not twenty others as well as he? eſpecially ſince you confeſſe ſome of your doctrine not to have had Vniverſall Tradition, but onely Tradition enough; which if thoſe Fathers did not think they had had, for this, they would never have receiv'd it, but have excepted againſt the Hereticall way of their delivery, if they had known that to be a private one, and a private one to be ſuch, and if they were ſo deceived in this way, might not they,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:165888:62"/>and more have been ſo too in other points, and in time all?</p>
            <p>If you ſay (as it hath been ſaid to me by one whoſe judgment I value, as much as any one of your Party) that if this opinion had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had Tradition, it could never have been ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally extinguiſh'd. I anſwer, that I affirm not, that it had, but onely that if the rules of your part be good and valid, then it had; I am ſure it hath better colour to plead upon, then any of thoſe other doctrines, which you impoſe upon us: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides although it had, yet when Doctors of great authority with the people, had won upon many, firſt not to think it Tradition, and then not true, and laſtly their courage encreaſing with their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, (for Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> durſt not call it) had made it accounted an Hereſie, it is not ſtrange that none ſhould riſe to oppoſe it; for by that time burning was come in faſhion, which was a ready way to anſwer all objections, and end all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, eſpeciall Piety being grown more cold, and ſo men leſſe apt to ſuffer for opinions, and the times more ignorant, and ſo men leſſe able to examine what had been beleeved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. But you who affirm, that your Church receives nothing, but what hath come to her by Verball Tradition down from the Apoſtles, muſt not onely deſtroy the Arguments, which prove this to have had Tradition, (which you, or any elſe will be never able to do) but muſt affirm, that the contrary hath ſuch, which yet their moſt ancient oppoſers never pretended too, but

            <p>Let us next conſider that controverſie which more afflicted the Church, and for a longer time then any other, that between the <hi>Arrians</hi> and their Adverſaries, and let us ſee, whether even againſt thoſe there were any ſuch.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:165888:63"/>that before <hi>Arrius</hi> aroſe, the Eccleſiaſticall Writers ſpoke <hi>minùs cautè,</hi> with leſſe circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though it brings ſome ſalve to the preſent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, yet it is a weapon againſt Tradition in generall, for if through want of care the beſt and wiſeſt men vs'd to contradict Tradition, (as you muſt grant they did) then ſure much more likely, when they taught by word of mouth, when leſſe care is alwaies us'd, then in Bookes, and how then can any age be ſure, that by this reaſon (of <hi>minùs cautè loquuti ſunt</hi>) their Anceſtors have not miſtaken their Fathers, and miſlead their Poſterity? Look but into <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and ſee but what he anſwers to what is brought againſt him out of <hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus,</hi> truly in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when he ſtrives to make it Catholique Doctrine, he doth it with no leſſe pulling, and halling, then <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> uſeth to agree the articles of the Engliſh Church with the Tenets of the Roman.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:165888:63"/>Religion, as Chriſt's Reſurrection, have ever ſo ſlightly eſteemed the Queſtion, when it firſt aroſe, neither would <hi>Alexander</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> have remain'd any while in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, as <hi>Zozomen</hi> ſaith he did, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) they were therefore faine to try it by Scripture, (eſteeming Written Tradition, as ſufficient a Rule, as Verball) as you may ſee by <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s own words at the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi>

               </gap>. The Bookes of the Evangeliſts, and the Apoſtles, and the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Ancient Prophets teach us clearly what we are to think of the Divinity. Let us therefore cut of theſe Divinity-inſpir'd diſcourſes, ſeek the ſolutions of our Queſtions, which being the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Propoſition, and paſſing uncontradicted (which the Biſhops would not have ſuffr'd it to do, if they had known yours to be ſo much the beſt, and moſt certaine way, and this ſo hazardous as you ſuppoſe) we have reaſon to believe that they for want of your direction made the Scripture their Rule, and ſought out for Truth by the ſame way, that we damnable Hereticks do, and by that condemn'd the <hi>Arrians,</hi> as not having ſuch a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as you ſpeak of, (or if they had, which is very unlikely) counting it ſo inſufficient, as that they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:165888:64"/>were not to conclude by that. Neither did onely that ancient, (and not yours) Councell, but even your own Modern ones ſhew, that they went upon other grounds, ſince to have had every Biſhop askt what he receiv'd from his Teachers, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from theirs, as come downe from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, would ſure have been the ſhorteſt way to find Truth, and if they had thought it the beſt too, it would have ſav'd the Friers at Trent many a long diſpute out of Scripture, Fathers, and Reaſon, and the Biſhops many a weary ſeſſion before any thing could be determined, or the Parties brought to agree. Beſides there is another reaſon (if I may be pardon'd a little inſiſting upon my digreſſion) which perſwades me that your own Councels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine not upon your grounds (that is) becauſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a thouſand Catholique Biſhops meet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine any thing, yet wee know it is not among you believ'd <hi>de Fide,</hi> without it be confirmed by the Pope; which ſhewes plainly enough, that you think not they went by ſuch a Tradition, ſince of that eighty, ſo many perſons from ſo many ſeveral Parts are witneſſes beyond exception, according to your own grounds, and that their Infallibility is not thought to depend upon an Impoſſibility; that (in the matter of Fact what hath been taught under that Notion) they ſhould either deceive, or be deceiv'd, but upon an infallible aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, which may be wanting to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, whereof the Pope is no part, or of whoſe decrees he is no confirmer. Now to return to my proofes, that againſt the <hi>Arrians</hi> there was no ſuch
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:165888:64"/>Tradition as you ſpeak of, (at leaſt, that was the ground upon which they were condemned,) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, if you pleaſe, that in that Epiſtle which <hi>Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> writ to ſome <hi>Arrians</hi> after the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Nice,</hi> he ſaith, Firſt, that they aſſented to the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, ſome eloquent and illuſtrious Biſhops and Writers had us'd the Terme: In which I note, that neither claim'd he any ſuch Verbal Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for this as you ſpeak of, and of that ſort which he claim'd, he names onely <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> ſome, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too many had writ otherwiſe to give ſuch a Tradition leave to be generall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He ſaith, they conſented to Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize the Contradictors, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to hinder men from uſing unwritten words, by which he ſaith (and that truely) that all confuſion hath come upon the Church. And if it be askt why the ſame reaſon made them not keep out the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, I anſwer, That I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (or elſe he is not conſtant to his own reaſon) that he meant onely thoſe words to be unwritten, which were in Scripture, neither themſelves, nor equivalently, whereas he took <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be in the Scripture in the latter ſence: And that by written, he meant in the Scripture onely, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by what followes, that no divinely-inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red writing (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) uſing the <hi>Arrians</hi> Phraſe, it was neither fitting to ſay nor teach them: Neither can you ſay that <hi>Euſebius</hi> being himſelf a ſecret <hi>Arrian</hi> prevaricated herein,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:165888:65"/>for <hi>Theodoret</hi> makes this Epiſtle an Argument againſt than, which he would not have done, if either it had ſeem'd to him to ſay any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Catholique doctrine, or not to have oppos'd the contrary by a Catholique way, at leaſt without giving his leader ſome Caution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.</p>
            <p>All which reaſons move me to think, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Chriſtians had not been alwaies taught the contrary to <hi>Arrius</hi>'s doctrine, but ſome one way, others the other, moſt neither, as having been onely ſpoken of upon occaſions, and therefore me thinks you had better either ſay with the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, that the Truth was concluded (as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſaid it ſhould be) by Arguments from Scripture, or (as ſome of your own ſay of other points) that before the Councell it lay in <hi>Archivis Eccleſiae,</hi> in the Deskes of the Church, then claime ſuch a Tradition for it, as appeares it can never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended that it had.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider but two opinions more:</p>
            <p>That Infants are not to receive the Euchariſt, is now both the doctrine and practiſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but ſix hundred yeeres the Church us'd it; Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> accounted it neceſſary at leaſt in ſome ſence of the word, if not abſolutely (which laſt is moſt likely, becauſe from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of that, which could not be receiv'd but by them who had received Baptiſme, he, and <hi>Innocentius</hi> a Pope, prove the neceſſity of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme) and an Apoſtolicall Tradition. If
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:165888:65"/>therefore both theſe Ages had gone by your Rule, how comes this difference between their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Sacrament being the ſame it was, and the Children the ſame they were?</p>
            <p>This I may conſider, and ſee if the ſame way that this Doctrine hath been altered, whether any other might not have received change?</p>
            <p>Next, that Saints are invocable, you muſt ſay, is Tradition taught from Father to Sonne, as deriv'd from the Apoſtles, if you will be conſtant to your own principle, now though I might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this, firſt by the many Fathers that beleeved, the <hi>Juſt</hi> not to be admitted to the Beatificall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before the day of judgement (for upon this your ſide now grounds that) but to be kept in ſecret receptacles, and by the long time which paſs'd before this doctrine was condemn'd: Secondly, by the beginning of it, which was particular Doctors Hipotheticall prayers, with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and ſuch conditionall clauſes: And thirdly, by <hi>Nicephorus Caliſtus</hi> his Relation (who in this is a believable witneſſe, becauſe he allowes of your opinion) that prayers to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> were firſt brought into the publick Liturgie by one <hi>Petrus Gnapheus</hi> a Heretick, about five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after Chriſt,<note place="margin">

               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:165888:67"/>leaſt the <hi>Pagans</hi> ſhould think themſelves brought againe to the worſhipping of Men inſtead of Gods: If upon this or any other reaſon this were not then taught, then have not all your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines ſuch a Pedigree as you ſuppoſe, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it were, yet, howſoever it followes, that, ſome, at leaſt, of the learned of your Church have not been taught that they have, or conſequently that it is neceſſary they ſhould have: Though it ſeemes to me little leſs then <hi>Montaniſme</hi> to believe that any ſince (as it were a Paraclet) ſhould perfect the doctrine which then was delivered by the Apoſtles: Neither can you anſwer that they ſpeake onely of ſuch a Precept, and of being extant, whereas they might teach it lawfull without giving any Precept, and they might have given ſuch a Precept although not extant; for I ſhould readily reply, that the reaſon they give why there is none ſuch extant, ſhewes, that they mean there was none at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Precept, nor allowance, ſince the <hi>Pagans</hi> would have been ſcandaliz'd at its being accounted lawfull to worſhip men inſtead of Gods, although it were not commanded, and not a whit the leſſe, whether that in after times were extant or not, which they could not foreſee.</p>
            <p>The onelie anſwer which I am able to invent in your behalfe, is this, that though ſome of your particular doctrines have not ſuch a Tradition, yet there being a Tradition that the Churches definitions are infallible, whatſoever ſhe at any time define, is then to be believed upon the ſtrength of ſuch a Tradition, and before did <hi>latere in cauſis</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:165888:67"/>as Flowers do in Winter.</p>
            <p>Yet to this I may reply by deſiring you to enter with me into ſome few conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If this were ſo, and that ſo much of Chriſtian Religion depends upon the definitions of the Church, and our Reception of them, upon knowing alwaies which is ſhe, and that ſuch is her authority, can you perſwade your ſelfe, that Chriſt ſending his Apoſtles and Diſciples to Preach the Goſpel, and after four of them writing his Goſpel, (which ſhewes if the Books be true to the title, that they writ all they preacht, at leaſt that was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; for elſe they were not Goſpels, but Parts of it) that they ſhould not rather leave out any thing elſe, how important ſoever, then not have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied themſelves about teaching us, that the Churches Definitions are a Rule of our Faith, and inſtructing us in Markes ſo proper to her, that we might never need to doubt, whether it be ſhe that defines or no, and whether their not having done this, evince not in Reaſon that this your Doctrine is falſe?</p>
            <p>Secondly, I pray conſider whether if there were any ſuch continu'd Tradition about the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions of the Church, whether that muſt not alſo have taught, (or elſe have been to ſmall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) when it is that the Church hath defin'd: but yet that is a caſe not fully judged among you, For ſome hold, that the Church hath defin'd when a Councel hath, although unapproved by the Pope, which is denied by others.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider whether (ſuppoſing as was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:165888:68"/>before ſuppos'd) it muſt not alſo have taught cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Notes to know the Church by: but yet about thoſe you are not agreed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tom.</hi> 13. Pag. 193.</note> 
               <hi>Salmeron</hi> putting Miracles among the falſe Signes of the Church, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and many more among the True ones.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Conſider whether the Church have an eternall ſpring of Doctrines within her, or but a finite number, and onely thoſe which the Apoſtles preacht: and I believe you will pitch upon the latter. Not then to ask how they come to know them, nor, if you anſwer by Tradition, to ask you againe how come men then not to know (before a Definition) what it is they Preacht? for if the Biſhops (of which a Councell is compounded) know it not now, how will they know it when they meet? I will deſire to know why the Church will not at once teach us all the knowes, and not keep us in doubts, which ſhe may reſolve? and did the, Apoſtles teach their Doctrines to be lockt up, or taught to us? And then having conſidered this, you will find I believe, that the Church do with Doctrines, as Fathers with Eſtates, never give their Children all, that they may ſtill have ſomething to keep them in awe with; becauſe if ſhe ſhould, ſhe could never have after pretended a Power to end any new emergent controverſie, keeping in ſecret what ſhe knowes, any that ariſeth, ſhe may ſtill pretend is endable by her.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Conſider that it will appear but a ſhift, if you ſay that there is a Tradition that all the Churches Definitions be true, and ſo excuſe the particular Doctrines, for otherwiſe having none,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:165888:68"/>and yet avoid giving us any Rules to know the Church by at all times, and anſwering thoſe Queſtions, which muſt be ended before we can know at any time when ſhe hath defin'd.</p>
            <p>Now I confeſſe if you had ſaid Tradition teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the particular Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſo the Admiral ſhip, that we may know any other if it be of God's Fleet, becauſe then it muſt follow her, that is, be ſubject to her decrees, &amp; theirs which joyn with her, this would have bin plainly to let me know your mind, and we might quickly have examin'd, whether there were any Tradition for the Church in this ſence to be alwaies obeyed when ſhe Teaches, and without you ſay this, you ſay nothing, and will never be able to give any ſuch Note of the Church, as the ignorant may without bluſhing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to know it by: Becauſe therefore I gueſſe, that when not I, but your Adverſaries reaſons (for I am but one of the worſt tranſcribers of them) have driven you from your own Fort, you muſt retire to that of your friends, or like them which are drowning, you will rather catch at a Twigg, then ſink: I will conſider this Aſſertion, which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you muſt lay hold of ſo far forth as to ſhew it to be indeed but an Aſſertion. That there hath no ſuch Verbal Tradition (nor indeed any) come downe, ſeems to me for theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> by oppoſing the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that with many Biſhops about the Rebaptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhewes ſufficiently, that he and they knew of no ſuch Tradition; and then in what Cave muſt it have lain hid, if the chiefe Doctor of that age was
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:165888:69"/>ignorant of it, and even his Adverſaries claim'd it not? And that he knew no ſuch, appears not onely by his Actions, but alſo by his words; for to them who claim'd Tradition for the particular point propos'd, (though none for the Authority of the Church propoſing) he anſwers, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Goſpels, Epiſtles, or Acts, let it be obſerved, at one blow cutting off not onely that (for ſure this authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is no way taught in the Scriptures) but all other unwritten Traditions, which Cardinal <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> thought moſt skilfull in that kind of Fence, was not able to ward, but <hi>Du Pleſis</hi> objecting it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd no other anſwer, then that the opinion of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> was condemn'd, and that Tradition, although unwritten, maintain'd. Which anſwer though it be as far from befitting the Cardinall, as from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the objection (ſince it is plaine, that this opinion was once held by ſuch as were of chiefe eſtimation among the Orthodox, and conſequently the contrary was not then the generall and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary doctrine of Chriſtians, and the prevailing of the one ſince proves not the other falſe, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unfortunate, or the ſpreaders (faulty) yet I confeſſe I excuſe him, for as I have learnt from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that it is ridiculous to expect a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration where the matter will beare but a probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſo would it be in me to expect even a probable ſolution of an Argument, the evidence of which will ſuffer none at all.</p>
            <p>Neither was he (I mean <hi>Cyprian</hi>) the firſt, that without blot of Hereſie oppos'd the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:165888:69"/>of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but that courage which he left to others after him, when they ſaw the Chriſtian World joyne in counting him a Saint, and a Martyr, whom the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had ſtiled a falſe Chriſt, and a falſe Apoſtle, the ſame had he received by ſeeing that the <hi>Aſian</hi> Biſhops had alſo rejected, and oppos'd her Tradition; and yet <hi>Policrates</hi> ever had in great honour, and the reſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver branded with the crime of Hereſie; nay, even the more neighbouring Biſhops, and who joyn'd with the Pope in the time of celebrating <hi>Eaſter</hi> (as <hi>Iraeneus</hi>) yet thought the difference not worth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and for want of skill in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law, tranſgreſt ſo farre as to reprehend for it, whereas if to that Church all elſe had been to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves, then <hi>Iraeneus</hi> ought therefore to have thought the matter of weight enough, becauſe ſhe thought it ſo, who were to ſmall purpoſe made a Judge, if ſhe were not as well enabled to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between ſlight and materiall, as between Falſe and Truth, though that it ſeemes ſhe was not: for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> never refus'd their Communion before, though ſhe knew them to hold the ſame opinion, and ſo (as plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares) counted that materiall in one Age, which ſhe had not ſo eſteemed in others, and therefore (in the degree at leaſt of holding what ſhe held) contradicted herſelf, and followed Traditions.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Cyprian</hi> imitated them, ſo did the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican</hi> Biſhops him, for a Queſtion hapning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> about <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales,</hi> though they abſolutely oppos'd him, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:165888:70"/>(in vaine I confeſſe) deſired him that he would not bring into the Church <hi>Typhum hujus Saeculi,</hi> the ſwelling pride of this World, and though he laboured infinitely in the buſineſſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>Having ever marked Error and Confidence to keep ſo much company, that I ſeldome find the firſt, but I miſtruſt the ſecond, makes me loath to affirme any thing over-dogmatically out of theſe objections, or ſay that they cannot be anſwered; Onely (becauſe I muſt not offend againſt Truth, for feare of offending againſt Modeſty) I will take leave to ſay, that if I could have anſwered them my ſelfe, I would not have put you to the trouble of doing it, which you might alſo have ſav'd, if by letting me know your name, you would have enabled me to have found you out, and ſo in a ſhort diſcourſe have tried whether I could have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that ſatisfaction from your words, which I muſt now expect from your Pen. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing I had none of theſe objections, yet two things beſides would have kept me from aſſenting to what you ſay: The firſt is, that your men, when they aske us how we know Scripture to be Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and this to be the ſence of it, tell us withall, that unleſſe we know it by ſome more infallible way then our owne Reaſon (they mean their Church) it will not ſerve for a beliefe of thoſe things which are to be believ'd by a divine Faith; Now this Argument of yours upon, which you
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:165888:71"/>build all, (allowing that it appear'd good reaſon) yet at moſt it is but reaſon, and liable to the ſame exceptions, unleſſe the ſame thing be a wall when you leane upon it, and a bulruſh when we doe. The ſecond is, that all you ſay (for as yet you ſpeak not of the Authority of the Particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though you muſt at length come to it, though by that too little is to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) if it were granted, would but prove thoſe who adhere now to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be now in the right, but I asked for a guide, which might without new ſearch ſerve me the next yeer, as well as this; For (for all that you have prov'd) ſhe may leave the way you ſay ſhe now pretends to walk in, and attempt to reform too, (which I wiſh were as probable as it is poſſible) or there may ariſe a ſchiſme between two parts of thoſe Churches which now adhere to the <hi>Roman,</hi> and both may claime Tradition, (for what hath been may be againe) and how ſhall I know then which ſide to take, ſince both will ſeem equally good by that Touchſtone which you appoint me to try with. And if I be then ſent to try by Ancient Writers, it is certaine, that (beſides the fallibility of that way for the learned) this cannot be done at all by the ignorant, and it is probable that both Parties will fall into that abſurdity, into which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> daily runs, which is, that although the evidence which ſhe claimes by cannot well be exactlie read over in thirty yeares time, yet ſhe requires us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paine of Damnation to give our Verdicts for her by twenty yeeres old.</p>

For my part ſuppoſing as I doe, that his Faith is in a ſufficient degree, which brings forth obedience, I require not any motives more, aſſuring (except from them who claime, that they cannot erre) then ſuch as any man unpraepoſſeſt with paſſion or prejudice will beleeve ſufficiently to obey; and ſuch in my opinion are mine: For though I know, you count any way without a guide but groping in the dark, yet if God had nor given us ſo much light as we deſired, we muſt not therefore ſet up falſe lights, and becauſe we would be ſure to have a guide, make one our ſelves: But he ſeemes to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:165888:72"/>me, to have dealt with us in Religon not very un-analogically, to what he hath in the world, giving us two lights, Scripture, and Univerſall Tradition, whereof one gives light to the other, and both to us: Univerſall Tradition is our Guide to Scripture (as whatſoever elſe that guided us to we would receive, if there were any ſuch thing) and Scripture is our way to God; By Univerſall Tradition we know much better, that theſe Books were written by Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (who are ſufficient witneſſes of what he taught) then the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> know that theſe were <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> works, or the <hi>Academicks</hi> knew <hi>Plato's,</hi> ſince Chriſtians have both kept them with more care, and in the acceptance of them uſed more caution, as thinking them ſo much more important: In the Scripture I conceive, that (according to that rule, which I am ſure I have either read in <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> or very often quoted out of him) <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:165888:73"/>what it meant, and be in a Propenſion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, that when he knowes it, me thinkes (as <hi>Cineas</hi> told <hi>Pirrhus</hi>) you had as good doe that at firſt, which you muſt doe at laſt, that is, ſay the ſame with us at firſt concerning Scripture, which after much trouble, you are forced to ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Councels, and in hard matters let the ſame implicite Faith in God ſerve, which ſerves in them, who can claime no authority but from, and under him: And (which is more then I affirme) that no man, but by his own, being wicked, can come into any error by falſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture, ſee I pray, what Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaies in his forty ninth Sermon <hi>de Verbis Domini,</hi> that God hath ſo hedg'd in all his own ſayings, that whoſoever would interpret any place of Scripture falſe, he that hath a circumciſed heart by reading what is before and after, may find that ſence which the other would pervert.</p>
               <p>Yet if you can ſhew me reaſon to beleeve that there is any ſtanding guide upon earth (and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon it were unreaſonable to hope to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me to beleeve it) I will never be proud ſo much to my own coſt, as rather to venture looſing my way by chuſing it my ſelfe, then be beholding to him for directing me in it.</p>

               <p>True it is, that very little is generally and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantlie taught in all ages to the people, and that which; is ſeldome, is told them to have been ſo receiv'd from hand to hand by the verball Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you ſpeak of; and if they be at any time taught ſo, and remember it, yet they know not whether the next Curate teach the ſame, at leaſt,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:165888:78"/>if under the ſame notion and degree of Neceſſitie: Indeed it would not be ſo intricate a worke (as now adaies it is) to be a Chriſtian, if your way had been onely followed: but it is not this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but the writings of paſt Ages, which tranſmit to poſteritie the opinions of the Doctors of paſt times, many of them being erroneous, and more unneceſſarie; out of theſe works the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned learne, and teach againe in their workes, what the greater part (the unlearned) ſcarce ever heare of; out of theſe they ſettle the degrees your Doctrines are to be held in, ſome as probable, ſome true, ſome almoſt neceſſarie, ſome altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and teach concerning others, that ſome are falſe, ſome dangerous, ſome damnable, whereas the vulgar have ſeldome their meat ſo curiouſlie joynted to them, but are told in generall for the moſt part (unleſſe ſome publick oppoſition, or other occaſion perſwade them at ſome time to deſcend to teach them more parcicularlie) that this is ſo good, and this is not ſo: And indeed the degree in which the laſt Age held ſuch an opni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is both moſt hard to know (not onely becauſe the ignorant are ſeldom taught it by word of mouth, and the learned have ſeldome occaſion, without ſome oppoſition, to explaine themſelves ſo farre in their writings,) but becauſe alſo as many, and as conſiderable Perſons not writings, as doe write, we cannot know by the Authors, what the whole Age thought true (except the acceptation of that Doctrine were a condition of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion)

                  </gap>, ſow Tares among the Tradition of the Apoſtles and Fathers: if when they make this claime they either ſay ſo, and think not ſo, or think ſo, and erre, then this proves, that though the <hi>Roman</hi> Church did make that claime which you ſay ſhe doth, yet ſhe too might either claime it againſt her Conſcience, or againſt Truth: For this claime of the laſt cannot be denyed but by him, who will imitate that <hi>Hamſhire</hi> Clown, of whom you give me warning, and believe no more then he ſees himſelf, eſpecially ſince your own Authors, when they diſpute for Traditions, prove their authority from this profeſſion of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> but I cannot blame you to forget them, (if we would ſuffer you) ſince they cannot be remembred but by your Religions diſadvantage; For I verily believe, that if they had but one Addition which they want, (I mean Riches) not onely moſt of them who leave the Proteſtants, would ſooner go to them then to you, (unleſſe they would take their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as we take Boates, for being the Next) but money among you, who (though they diſlike your pretended Infallibility, that the Popes uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations upon the rights of other Biſhops, his (not ancient) claime of power to deliver Soules out of Purgatory, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> And yet are frighted from joyning with the Proteſtants, by want of Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

               </p>
               <p>But (although there were no ſuch Churches, or they made no ſuch claime, yet having ſhew'd out of your own Authors, that ſome opinions have not been conſtantly delivered by Tradition, but have entered into the Church upon the grounds (which might at leaſt poſſiblie deceive them) of Scripture, Reaſon, and Revelation, and others knockt apace to be let in) I hope we may be excuſed for making a reveiw of all, and examining what doctrines have been brought in, if not by Scripture (which we think reaſonable) at leaſt by comparing what this age teacheth and requires, with what the firſt Ages did; to which we are encourag'd by your ſelves, who make agreement with Antiquitie, the chief mark of the Church, unleſſe you meane your ſelves to be onelie Judges, even of thoſe things by which you bid us to judge you: For our examinations by reaſon, I cannot tell why you miſlike it, ſince thoſe who truſt their own reaſon leaſt, truſt it yet to chuſe for them one whom they may truſt, againſt which, all Arguments drawn from her fallibilitie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion lie. Your Religion is built upon your Church, her authoritie upon reaſons, which we think ſlight and fallacious, and your ſelves think but prudentiall and probable; ought we not then, nay, muſt we not examine them by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:165888:84"/>or receive them upon your word? And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them probable reaſon, yet I have ſtill cauſe to examine further, whether your ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions be not more unreaſonable then your foundations are reaſonable, for then I cannot receive a more, unprobable doctrine, then that is probable, which it is prov'd by: Yet (in reſpect of things appearing divers, at divers times) I doe not like my own way ſo well, as to eſteem it abſolutelie infallible, but though I keep it, becauſe I account it the beſt, yet I will promiſe to leave it, when you can ſhew me a better, which will be hard to doe, becauſe you cannot prove it to be better but by reaſon, againſt which proofe (and conſequentlie againſt whatſoever it proves) your own Objections .remaine; For to be perſwaded by reaſon, that to ſuch an authoritie I ought to ſubmit it, is ſtill to follow reaſon, and not to quit her. And by what elſe is it, that you examine what the Apoſtles taught, when you examine that by ancient Tradition, and ancient Tradition by a preſent Teſtimonie? Yet when I ſpeake thus of finding the Truth by Reaſon, I intend not to exclude the Grace of God, which I doubt not (for as much as is neceſſarie to Salvation) is readie to concurre to our Inſtruction; as the Sunne is to our ſight, if we by a wilfull winking chuſe not to make, not it, but our ſelves guilty of our blindneſſe: Indeed if we love darkneſſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then light, and inſtead of eſteeming it, ſhut it out, it were but juſt in God, if we ſo continue long hardened, not to ſuffer it to ſee after when
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:165888:84"/>we would, ſince ſo obſtinatelie we would not when we might, like to that which happened to thoſe Engliſhmen, of whom <hi>Froiſſard</hi> ſpeakes, who having long bound up an eye, and made a fooliſh vow, never to ſee with that till they could ſee their Miſtreſſes, when they returned, and unbound them, they ſaw nothing, but that they could not ſee.</p>
               <p>Yet when I ſpeake of Gods grace, I mean not, that it infuſeth a knowledge without reaſon, but workes by it, as by its Miniſter, and diſpels thoſe Miſts of Paſſions, which doe wrap up Truth from our Underſtandings. For if you ſpeake of its inſtructing any other way, though I confeſſe it is poſſible (as God may give us a ſixth ſence) yet it is not ordinarie, and ought not to be brought to diſpute, becauſe ſo we leave viſible Arguments to flie to inviſible, and your Adverſarie, when he hath found your play, will be ſoon at the ſame locke, and I beleeve in this ſence, infus'd Faith is but the ſame thing, otherwiſe apparell'd, which you have ſo often laught at in the <hi>Puritans,</hi> under the title of private Spirit.</p>

               <p>The firſt is of <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and making peace with a Nation which was not ſo, and ſuppoſing that they would never have firme concord with him, to whom in Faith he was ſo oppoſite, was adviſed to perſwade their Biſhop to change his beleife, for which end having employ'd both words and money, and effected it, the Biſhop,<note place="margin">Theodoret lib <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> directlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> being himſelfe weakened, weakened his brethren, who yeelded to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with the <hi>Arrians</hi> (which before they abhorr'd from) and to eſteeme the Father greater then the Sonne.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, is of that <hi>Macedonian</hi> Biſhop, who, being perſecuted by the Catholique Biſhop of the ſame place (who was then gone to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> to fetch Souldiers, by whoſe aſſiſtance he might afflict the Hereticks the more) reſolved to turne Catholicke, and perſwaded all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to joyne with him in that Act, and this in ſo ſhort a time, that when the other returned, he found him choſen Biſhop unanimouſlie by both Parties, and himſelfe (for his crulelty,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:165888:86"/>not undeſervedlie) excluded.</p>
               <p>There is beſides another thing which helpes to lett in great errors, which is, that men naturally neglect ſmall things, and ſmall things in time na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally beget great; for which cauſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhewing to us ſeverall cauſes of the Changes of Government, one of them is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, often a great chang comes ſtealingly in, when what is little is not conſidered.</p>
               <p>Yet beſides the generall careleſſneſſe; The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Teachers, the Flexibility of the Taught, and the ſmallneſſe of the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the beginning, even Intereſt it ſelfe (which conſiſts of two Parts, Feares, and Hopes) is able to produce great effects: Of this me thinkes your ſelves may be witneſſes, who uſe to call ours, a <hi>Parliamentary Religion,</hi> as thinking, that the Will of the Prince, and both Houſes, onely made it to be received: Whereas in the beginning of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Raigne, of many thouſand Livings which were in <hi>England,</hi> the Incumbents of not a hundred, choſe rather to loſe their Benefices for your opinions, then to keepe them by ſubſcribing to ours; all who (for the greateſt Part) of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity muſt be ſuppoſed for private intereſt, to have diſſembled their Religion, either then or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the Third Booke of <hi>Evagrius</hi> we find, that above five hundred Biſhops ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed againſt the Councell of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> which we have reaſon to think moſt did unwillingly, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:165888:86"/>if the Infallibility of a generall Councell were ſo famous a Doctrine for Catholiques as now it is) becauſe we know it was upon <hi>Baſiliſcus</hi> his commands, and that a conſiderable Part of them (the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia</hi>) profeſs'd after they were forct to it, though before they had been very angry in another Epiſtle with thoſe, who ſaid that they had done by force, rather then Free-will.</p>
               <p>And over, and above all this we may ſee by <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his words, that many might not oppoſe a Doctrine brought in by great Power, in hope of a time to do it in, when there might be more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood of prevailing: For he ſaith in one place of his Epiſtles, that thoſe who reſiſt opinions, when there is no probable meanes of doing good by it, are like thoſe, who out of ſeaſon attempt to break Priſon, who gaines nothing by it, but to have their Irons doubled upon them: And the ſame cauſe which he thinks ſhould move them to ſtay (outwardly) contentedly in Priſon, may have made many others not reſiſt, when they were firſt by violence and crowd carried thither, who might feare leaſt their oppoſall might not help their cauſe, but beget a definition againſt it. And there being thus many ſeverall motives which may work upon ſo many ſeverall kindes of men, it is no wonder, if an error may ſoon over-runne all men, or ſeem to do ſo.</p>
               <p>Next, Whereas you ſpeak of ſeverall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and Languages, I muſt deſire you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the Clergy of your Church are as it were all of one Language, (<hi>Latine</hi> either being, or
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:165888:87"/>being ſuppoſed to be, as much theirs, as that of their own People) and being under the Dominion of one, that is the Pope, which makes them as it were one Country, and from them the Laity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all their opinions: Nay in ancient times almoſt all conſiderable men ſpoke the Language of the governing Nation, (as all of the better ſort of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>) do <hi>Engliſh</hi>) and the greateſt part of Chriſtians were governed by one man, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and ſo a new opinion may eaſily have been received generally, no ſuch barres being ſet up to hinder it, as you alleadge.</p>

                  <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine is not a ſpeculative knowledge inſtituted for delight, but it is an Art of living, a Rule of attaining to eternall bliſſe; hence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that no error can fall, even in a point which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth wholly ſpeculative in Chriſtian Faith, but ſoon it breedeth a Practicall effect, or rather defection in Chriſtian behaviour.</hi>

               <p>If you mean the ſecond, (for ſo you muſt by your Inference, though the words of the Queſtion will bear both ſences) it is as impoſſible for you to receive an anſwer. For how ſhall I know when all it is granted? For ſuppoſe no Author to have been loſt, and me to have read and remembred them all; yet (as in <hi>England</hi> when the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> opinion prevailed moſt, as wiſe and learned men, as thoſe who writ, though differing in opinion from the Authors, yet oppoſed them not ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, but that many might believe the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

And of this, <hi>France</hi> may as well be an example as <hi>England,</hi> wherein many called <hi>Caſſandrians,</hi> diſſent from the publiquely received Doctrines, though with ſo little ſtirr, that our Poſterity will not know that there now are ſuch; So that all which any man can anſwer to this Queſtion, is, that ſuch a one was the firſt that he knowes of, who taught ſuch a Doctrine, and ſuch a time the firſt, wherein he knowes not that any contradicted it, or that your Church defines it for a neceſſary opinion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted aſſent to it, as a condition of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; which anſwer will be nearer to Truth or Falſhood, according to the meaſure of the anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers learning; And indeed if you pleaſe to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that when learning roſe againe, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation began, moſt <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Books, had long layn unreguarded by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallity in Popiſh Libraries, and out of them onely had ſome few been Printed, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that it was in the power of your Church, what anſwer we ſhould be able to make to that Queſtion which you propoſe, which then it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonder if it were not anſwered, for your willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to keep men in darkneſſe concerning this,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:165888:96"/>even in times of moſt light, is to be ſeen by your expurgatory Indexes: For there, though you profeſſe to meddle with none but Moderne Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, (whereas it is plaine you go as high as <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi>) yet both that will ſerve to deceive our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity concerning the generall opinions of theſe times, and if your Church in former Ages uſed any courſe ſomewhat Analogicall to this, upon thoſe Authors who then were moderne too, (as likely enough they did, or you have cauſe to hope they did for your more juſtification) then how can I know when any opinion entered, that is, either firſt was at all, or firſt by all taught: ſince in all times (how little mention ſoever be made of it) there may have been ſome Doctors of that opinion, though either no Authors, or allthough Authors, yet by this Stratageme may be kept from us.</p>
               <p>Neither indeed can you anſwer this Queſtion your ſelf, for you know not in what Year, or Age, did either the giving the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to Infants begin, or end, at leaſt Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> knew not the firſt, who believed it an Apoſtolical Tradition; Neither was this a bare Cuſtome, but implyed an opinion of good which Children received, which the change ſhewes plainely to have altered, and certainely either the firſt opinion was a Superſtition, or the latter a Sacriledge.</p>
               <p>But howſoever your Conſequence followes not, for though your Church conſpired, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Poſterity, yet it might not conſpire to deceive their Poſterity, but to inſtruct it, being themſelves deceived. And therefore when you

Neither indeed know I, how God hath made mankinde for his Elect: It is true, that having elected thoſe who ſhall perſevere in Faith and Obedience, and given man Free-will, which (joyned with Grace univerſallie offered) might bring him to the condition, and in that to election, and by that to Heaven; God may be ſaid, to have made mankinde for his elect, that is, to be his elect, if they ſhut not themſelves out of the way to be ſo; And all men (eſpeciallie Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) I beleeve have, and alwaies ſhall have meanes enough to performe theſe conditions, in ſuch a meaſure (all things conſidered, I meane, either naturall defects, as in Ideots, never having heard of Chriſt, as in many Pagans, not having Chriſts will ſufficientlie propoſed, as in many Chriſtians, and whoſoever is not by ſome fault in his will hindered from aſſenting, to him it is not propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſufficientlie) as ſhall by God be from them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:165888:97"/>
               <p>But this hinders not, but that all Chriſtians may ſee what they ſhould, if they ſtand not in their own light, or wilfullie winke, and if they neglect Chriſts Inſtructions or Commands, and make themſelves deafe againſt his voice, charme he never ſo wiſelie, they then may fall from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie Truths (much more from others) unto error, as well as from good life into wickedneſſe, from which, without queſtion, Gods Spirit is as readie to keep men that will be kept, as from the other, and which is no leſſe (if not more) part of the conditions required (for in that epitomie, which Chriſt hath given us of the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, men are onely mentioned to be puniſhed for want of Charitie, and not miſ-interpretations of doctrine) though I grieve to ſee ſo many of all parts (whereof I am too much one) live, as if God were ſo obliged to them for their Faith, that he were bound to winke upon their workes, and not to be an Idolater, or not a Heretick, were enough not to be damned.</p>
               <p>And certainlie to ſay, <hi>That one tittle of Gods Word ſhall not paſſe away,</hi> is not to ſay, that God will keepe here alwaies a knowne companie of men to teach us all Divine Truths, which from them, becauſe of their authoritie, we may without more adoe accept (for unleſſe you meane the Church in this ſence, it concernes not our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences) till you can prove that this word makes ſome ſuch promiſe. For this ſeemes to me onelie to ſhew the veracitie of Gods Word, without ſpeaking at all of any Churches continuall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:165888:98"/>to it, or true interpretation of it, or the impoſſibilitie of her receiving the Traditions of men for the will of God.</p>
               <p>Beſides in this Paragraph I obſerve three things:</p>
               <p>The firſt, That you now draw your Arguments from the ſtedfaſt Truth of Holie Writ, whereas you neither quote out of it any thing to prove your maine Aſſertion, and in that way, which you laid before to finde out Truth by, you tooke no notice at all of Scripture, but would have all differences decided, by onely comparing what men had by verball Tradition, like that <hi>Dominican,</hi> of whom <hi>Eraſmus</hi> tels us in his Epiſtles, that when in the Schooles any man refuted his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, by ſhewing it contrarie to the words of Scripture, he would crie out, <hi>Iſta eſt Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Lutherana, proteſtor me non reſponſurum;</hi> This is a Lutheran way of Arguing, I proteſt I will not anſwer to it.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, You now bring the proofe of your certaintie from Gods spirit never failing his Church (though you neither define what is there meant by Church, nor doe you bring any proofe, or ever can, that Gods Spirit will ſtay with any unleſſe they pleaſe it, or that this will not conſiſt with the leaſt error in divine matters) whereas before you made it a Phyſicall, or rather ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicall certaintie, that Traditions muſt be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from Age to Age uncorrupted, and this, not becauſe of any other aſſiſtance, but <hi>ex neceſsitate Rei.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:165888:98"/>
               <p>Thirdlie, You ſeeme to thinke, that aptneſſe to ſtartle in the faithfull, will ſerve to ſecure them from all error, whereas I muſt profeſſe my ſelfe, of opinion, that in ſome times, and ſome caſes, that may ſerve to induce it; for (it being trulie ſaid, that there is as much follie beyond wiſedome, as on this ſide of it, and <hi>Nazianzene</hi> telling us trulie, that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the marke is equallie miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by over ſhooting, as by ſhooting ſhort) I doubt whether over much caution may not have made ſome doctrines, and their Abetters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned (eſpeciallie when they appeared ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what new) ſome Truths rejcted for feare, leaſt they did by conſequence contradict ſome point of Faith, when indeed they did, <gap reason="foreign">

Ethick.</note> as Dogs often barke at a friend for an enemie, upon the firſt noiſe he makes, before having conſidered which he is: This made the Ancients ſo earneſt againſt the now-certaintie of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> this in after times, for the ſame opinion, coſt a Biſhop his Biſhopricke, and truth in all probabilitie, would have then beene defined a hereſie, if a generall Councell had been called about it: Since then this aptneſſe to ſtartle hath inclined Orthodox Chriſtians to condemn, not onely thoſe who had affirmed in termes the contrarie to Tradition, but even thoſe, from whoſe opinions they thought it would reſult, and conſequentlie to exact an Aſſent, not onely to direct Tradition, but alſo to whatſoever elſe ſeemed to them reaſonable
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:165888:99"/>deductions from it; This ſeemes to me a way by which Errors may have entered by ſhoales, the firſt Ages (I mean then, <hi>Cum</hi> Auguſtinus <hi>habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur inexpugnabilis Dialecticus, quòd legiſſet Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorias</hi> Ariſtotelis) not having been ſo carefull and ſubtile in their Logick, as theſe more learned times both <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Catviniſts, Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites, Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſeeming to me to argue much more conſequently to their owne Principles, more cloſe to their preſent buſineſſe, and every way more rationally then the ancient Doctors uſed to do I mean thoſe which I have ſeen: And I am confident, that if two or three Fathers ſhould riſe againe unknown, and ſhould return to their old. Argument againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> from <hi>Cor meum eructavit verbum bonum,</hi> both Parties would be ſo farr from receiving them for Judges, that neither would accept of them for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates, nor truſt their Cauſe to their arguing, who oppoſed their common enemy no better.</p>
               <p>Now that this way of making Deductions out of Tradition, and thoſe both very haſty, and falſe ones is very ancient, appeares even by an example in the end of the Goſpell of <hi>John,</hi> for there out of Chriſts words falſly interpreted, a concluſion was drawn and ſpread among the Bretheren, that Saint John ſhould not dye, and what they did out of theſe words of Chriſt, other in other times may have done out of other words of his, and their Collection paſſe for his Doctrine; which ſhewes the great advantage which we have by Gods Word being written ſince, if it had not, we could
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:165888:99"/>not alwaies have gone to a new examination of the very words, which Chriſt or his Apoſtles taught, and conſequently a conſequence of them ſpread in the place of them, would have been more incurable then now it is. I will alſo deſire you to look in the five hundered eighty fourth Page of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine Councell,</hi> ſet out by <hi>Binius,</hi> and there you will find, that the <hi>Latines</hi> confeſſe, that they added the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from the Son, to the Creed, becauſe the contrary opinion ſeemed to them by conſequence, contrary to a confeſſed Tradition of Chriſts eternall Divinity, to which, yet it will appear out of what Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> hath excellently ſhowne,<note place="margin">Con.

For as a Naturall Foole is not bound to obey any Doctrine or Precept, taught or impoſed by God himſelf, becauſe his underſtanding can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcover it to be ſo: ſo in my opinion, whoſe underſtanding ſoever is not convinc'd of the ſame, (how plain ſoever to others the thing be) he is for as much as concernes this point, in the ſtate of a Naturall Foole, and no more to be condemned.</p>
               <p>Neither ſee I what you prove out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the Church, and every mans Country, (for if any Church be intended by God to be ſo our Director, that her propoſitions are to be received, becauſe they are hers, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we owe her much more obedience then to our Country, which if it ſhould require of us to believe an opinion true, becauſe that hath defined it, I believe no man would obey, and he who ſhould preſs us to it, would be accounted ſo mad, that we ſhould ſend him, not to a Doctor of Divinity, but to a Doctor of Phyſick, to be confuted.</p>

               <p>Thus too, when the Orthodox company com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as they are Orthodox, that is ſomething of the will of God, then they are to be obeyed, and ſo am I, and ſo againe, when the choſen go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours for that purpoſe, command indifferent Things, but if they exceed their Commiſſion in commanding, no man is longer bound to obey, no more then if a <hi>Mayor</hi> of a Town ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the People to make his Hay, they were bound to obedience, ſince commanding more then his Magiſtracy authorizeth him, he in that caſe is no Magiſttate.</p>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:165888:107"/>ſince received by you all, and conſidering that multitude of your Church, which believe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Conception in as high a degree, as it is poſſible without excommunicating the deniers, who either walk not by that which you count the onely Catholique Rule, or elſe claime ſuch a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, who yet are not thought fit to ſway the reſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I pray obſerve how eaſie it was for the two firſt Ages, at leaſt the chiefe of them, and all that are extant, to have given aſſent to Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo unſufficiently teſtified, or to have miſtaken Doctrines under that notion, (for ſo they did to this of the <hi>Chiliaſts</hi>) and then after for it to ſpread till it were generall, and laſt as long as men laſt upon their authority, and when once it is ſo ſpread, how ſhall we then diſcover how ſmall an Originall it had, when peradventure the head and ſpring of it will be as hard to find, as that of <hi>Nilus,</hi> ſo that the greateſt part of what you receive, might poſſibly appear to be no certainer, nor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter built, if we could digg to the foundation: Wherefore, ſince the delivery of a Tradition by ſubſequent Ages hath its validity onely from the authority of the firſt, me thinks you ſhould either think that they received none but upon better grounds, or elſe think theſe grounds good.</p>

                  <hi>To the Grammarian I will give two Memorandums; firſt, that ſeeing the Catholick's were firſt in poſſeſsion both of the Scriptures, and the Interpretations: The adverſe part is bound to bring ſuch places as can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no probable Expoſition by the Catholickes. For who knoweth not, that is converſant in Criticks, how many obſcure and difficult places occurre in moſt plaine Authors, and the Scripture of all Bookes (the greater part of the men that wrote them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the New Teſtament, being not eloquent, and writing not in their native Tongue) for the moſt part, are ſubject to much impropriety: The other Memorandum is, that, to prove a Catholique point by Scripture, it is ſufficient, that the place brought, beare the Expoſition the Catholique giveth, and if it be the more probable by the very letter, it is an evincent place. The reaſon is, becauſe the queſtion being of a Chriſtian law, the Axiome of the Juriſts taketh place, that</hi> Conſuetudo optima Interpres Legis, <hi>ſo that if it be manifeſt, that Chriſtian practiſe (which was before the controverſie) bee for the one ſence, and the words be tolerable, no force of Grammer can prevaile to equalize this advantage: The Grammarian therefore, who will obſerve theſe Rules, I turne him looſe to the Scriptures and Fathers, to ſeeke there what is the Faith of Chriſt and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of her Church to know her by.</hi>

                  </label> To your firſt Memorandum, I anſwer, that you have grounded it wholly upon begging the queſtion: for if thoſe of your Religion had firſt been in poſſeſſion of the Scriptures, then the Chriſtians had been of it in the Apoſtles times,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:165888:116"/>which if you could prove, you would need to prove no more, but all would eaſilie follow: and then for your conſequence, that is equallie falſe, for though I confeſſe, to make any Doctrine a point of Faith, it is required, that the place be as plaine as you pleaſe, yet to the making it the more probable opinion (and conſequentlie excluding the contrarie from being neceſſarie) ſo much is not required. The greateſt cauſe of the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of thoſe bookes, in which Criticks are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant, is the negligence and ignorance of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers, ſo that ſome Authors would ſcarce know their own Bookes, if they were revived, whereas the great care of Chriſtians about ſo deare a pledge, hath much, if not wholly hindered, the ſame cauſe from perverting, and ſo obſcuring Scripture: At leaſt, if it have not, it ſeemes your Church is not ſo faithfull a Guardian of her depoſit, as her deare friends (moved by partiallitie or ends) would make us beleeve: Beſides, till now I ever thought, that Eloquence rather lead men to ſpeake impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie, then the want of it, ſince ignorant perſons keepe themſelves within the bounds of what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſelie they meane, whereas the eloquent wander into figures, which are ſo many, and have gotten ſuch footing in language (whilſt in the ſearch of ſignificancie proprietie is loſt) that thoſe, who uſe them, are obliged to thoſe who will pleaſe to underſtand, becauſe all they ſay may beare two ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the one proper, the other improper: And though it be true, that they have over-flowne, even into the language of the ignorant, yet it is as true,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:165888:117"/>that both they are much leſſe uſed among theſe, and that they had not hence their beginning, but from Eloquence: And though the Apoſtles write not in their native Tongues, yet they write in an inſpired language, ſo that they were not likely to commit, at leaſt, any ſuch ſoloeciſmes as ſhould deſtroy the end of the Inſpirer, which was, that they ſhould be underſtood by it.</p>
               <p>To your ſecond Memorandum I anſwer, that ſince every man is free till ſome thing binds him, you (who pretend, that we are bound to receive more doctrine as neceſſarie, then appeares to us to be ſo) are in all reaſon to give us plainlie evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent proofe, that what you thus require, God requires too, for till then (to returne you to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Axiome, for yours) <hi>praeſumitur pro libertate;</hi> whereas wee (the burden of the Negative proofe not lying upon us) if we bring probable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we doe it <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> and bring more then we need to bring; And whereas you ſtand upon Cuſtomes, having power in Law matters, I anſwer, that in all caſes that is not of force, for we hold, that it muſt not prevaile againſt a Statute, which ſhewes, that they may be contradictorie, and as <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi,</hi> is thought to be a good civill topicall Law, ſo me thinkes, <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit veritati,</hi> is a good publique divinitie Law, your owne Scripture too telling us, that Truth is ſtronger then the King; Beſides, where it is of force, it is in ſuch caſes as the law hath appointed that it ſhould be ſo, and if you can prove out of Chriſts Law, that there it is ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:165888:117"/>to be in matters of Divinity, wee ſhall willinglie yeild, but ſeeing that our law, which allowes this force to cuſtome, ſets downe alſo in how long time it is, before it become of force, and I have cauſe to thinke, that Chriſt would have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:165888:118"/>onely gives force to our lawes) may be as fit to bind, as a law in civill caſes, and yet not in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, where the lawes proceed from a higher foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that ſuch a rule may be good in civill reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, which require but probable proofes, and yet not in divine ones, where (according to the grounds of your Party, which requires an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubting aſſent to her doctrines as infallible) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible proofes are neceſſary, eſpecially this, like other Topycall arguments, having onely force <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> and againe good where it is not ſo neceſſary, that the will of the Legiſlator be followed, as that peace and quiet be preſerved, to which, all alterations, even to the better, are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and yet not in theſe caſes, where we are to prefer the will of our Law-maker before any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane convenience, or good, if the cuſtome paſt unqueſtioned, when the Law was firſt promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but not, if crept in after by negligence, or plainely appearing to have been brought in-by power, all this perſwading me not to be ſo farr ſwaied by your Rules as you would have me, I ſuppoſe you have ſmall hope, that not being ſo, I ſhould find either in Scripture, or the firſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, either that Faith which your Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, or theſe properties of Chriſts Church, by which your Church proves, or rather ſtrives to prove, that ſhe it is: Give me leave beſides to aske you one Queſtion, and that is; What we ſhall conclude when the Chriſtian practice of ſeverall places have ever differed; as that of <hi>Greece</hi> from that of <hi>Rome,</hi> which it may alſo do in more places then

                  </label> Firſt, What <hi>Fevardentius</hi> confeſſeth, proves plainlie that, for which I intended it, which was, the ridiculouſneſſe of proving their Doctrine to be true, by being conformable to that of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and yet making themſelves Judges of thoſe Judges they appeale too, and confeſſing, that many of them erred in many points, which if they did, they might as well doe the ſame in thoſe about which we differ, although they agreed with you, and diſſented from us.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, What both he confeſſeth, and you confeſſe with him, diſproves that way of knowing divine Truths which you propoſe, for neither the Doctors of the ancient Church (who were ſure more likelie to know what was then taken for Tradition, then any late Compilers) nor of the Modern, who had a mind to deliver truth, and trac'd and followed your way of finding it, could erre in points of faith, if <hi>Qui docet ut didicit,</hi> he that teacheth as he hath been taught, muſt ſtill be in the right, for publique Tradition, no learned man, at leaſt can be ignorant, not any man (ſay you) of what he was taught when a Childe, as the ſubſtance of his hopes for all eternitie, and ſo cannot in reaſon have his books either forbidden or paſted up, for delivering any thing contrary to it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Who are theſe Cenſors who forbid and paſte up books, certainly not the Univerſall
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:165888:128"/>Church, nor yet the Repreſentative, the latter is not alwaies in being, nor when it is, at leaſure to conſider and judge all authors, and of the firſt theſe Authors are a part, if then they be fallible, (as they muſt be if they be not the Church) why may not they erre, and the Martyr-books ſpeake truth, which yet will eaſily by this meanes be kept from Poſteritie, if thoſe in the Dictatory Office diſſent from it as they will be ſure to do, if the opinion contradict never ſo little the power or greatneſſe of the Pope, upon whoſe favour theſe Oecumenicall Correctors muſt depend, or they not long remaine in their places: and yet you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that your adverſary ſhould produce ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their opinions in all ages, though nothing be let paſſe but what a few pleaſe, and though when in time all of you are agreed (as you will ſoon be or appear to be, if one ſide appear to be gag'd) then this conſent, though thus brought about, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the conſent of the Church, and a very notable Motive.</p>
               <p>And ſince you ſay, that what all are bound to, is onely a prompt ſubjection to the Church, why leave you it ſo in doubt, what is the Church, as if men were tyed to be ſubject, but muſt not know to what; you ſay indeed, that the adherers to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are now the Church, but what they may be, you will not plainely declare; So that if a Schiſme among them ſhould happen, we are all as farrto ſeek as if you had been wholly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, for ſince the infallibility lies not in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and conſequently the adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:165888:129"/>to her is not ever a ſufficient note of the Church, (as you will not ſay) nor is it among your ſelves <hi>de fide,</hi> ſince the Univerſall Church (whatſoever ſhe be) can never define any thing, and of the authority of the definitions of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, and of what conſtitutes both her and her decrees, you refuſe to ſpeak, what remaines there, to which this prompt ſubjection is to be the onely everlaſting Note of the true Church, but onely the Truth whenſoever ſhe appeares; Thus as the Prieſts of <hi>Apollo</hi> (therefore peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called <hi>Loxias</hi>) uſed to ſpread lies, and ſecure his reputation, the firſt by the antiquity, and the ſecond by the darkneſſe of his Oracles, ſo doth your Religion gaine upon many men, and ſecure her ſeflf rom many objections, by the manyfold acceptions, and conſequently difficulty of this tearme Church; For whatſoever is ſaid in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concerning her being free from all ſpot, or prevailing againſt the gates of Hell, or their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger who reſiſt her, the firſt meant (as I believe, and the place denies not by any circumſtance) of the Church Triumphant, the ſecond of the Church of the Elect, and the third, of the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity in generall, or at moſt of thoſe who are in all neceſſary points Orthodox among them; That they without ſufficient proofe reſolve to be ſpoken of the Church in their ſence they have fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied; That is, ſome ever known body of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans which muſt be ſtill guide to the reſt, and then claime to be that, becauſe no other (all elſe being more ingenious) claimes it beſides themſelves,

Againe, they prevaile much by working upon mens aſſents, by the meanes of their modeſties, and preſſe it to be an intollerable pride to oppoſe their opinions to the conſent of the Catholick Church; whereas, if it be weighed how ſmall a part of it they mean by that word, and yet of them how many follow blindly the decrees of one, and how ſoon thoſe prevaile againſt that few not backed by any power who do not, it will then appeare, that not onely other Churches, but even a <hi>John</hi> or a <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> have as much reaſon to be lead by their own underſtandings, as by the opinions and decrees of and <hi>Vrban</hi> or a <hi>Gregory,</hi> upon which that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is ſo often founded; And as they make their advantage of this word in their offenſive warres, ſo do they in their defenſive, for when they are preſs'd unto the abſurdity of their Tenets, then (though indeed they be generall) yet they pretend, that they are the opinions but of private, though many men, and not of the Church; and againe, when any Fathers (who yet ſometimes they ſay

For call the Church what you will; the Congregation of the Elect, the Congregation of the Faithfull, the Congregation of Saints, or Juſt; call it, I ſay, or define it what you will, doth it not clearly follow, that whoſoever is out of the Church cannot be ſaved, for he ſhall not be the Elect, Juſt, Faithfull, &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there is no ſalvation.

               <p>Thirdlie, Malefactors are not, or ſhould not be puniſhed for ſuch, without a plaine knowledge that ſuch they are; but although there were an impoſſibilitie of miſtaking what is Hereſie, yet there is no poſſibilitie of knowing who are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, the forme of which is obſtinacie, a ſecret, and (to man) an undiſcoverable qualitie, whom he onelie ſhould puniſh who onelie knowes.</p>
               <p>Fourthlie, Malefactors are certaine to hurt others, whereas neither are Heretickes ſure to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwace any, and if they doe, yet they may hurt none, ſince who receives their beleife <hi>bona fide,</hi> and through meer error, is unharmed by it.</p>
               <p>Fifthlie, Whom they doe harme, it muſt be brough their own fault, and by their own conſent, whereas without either, the Malefactors are cauſe of much miſchiefe, even to the moſt guiltleſſe.</p>

               <p>Seventhly, The puniſhment even by death, of Malefactors brings not any temptation of ſinning, upon them, the ſame to others is in all probabilitie a cauſe to keep many from a carefull ſearch of Gods Truth, (leaſt they might find the puniſhable beleefe to be the true one) and from profeſſing it, when they think they have found it; both which are ſinns of the firſt magnitude.</p>
               <p>Eigthly, This courſe with Malefactors was not, for ought appears, ever thought unlawfull in the pureſt times of Chriſtianity, and was then in uſe, whereas towards errors in beleefe, it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed of them by the chiefe, and long before death was at all inflicted upon them, though then underſtood as well the danger of Hereſie, and were as carefull to preſerve their flocks from all danger by all lawfull waies, as any ſince.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, It no way redounds to Chriſts Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that Malefactors be unpuniſht, but it makes much for it, that his Army appears to conſiſt of Volunteers, and not of Preſs'd men, that his Truth ſhould prevaile by no humane force, but onely by the power of the firſt teacher, and the light of the Doctrine, which for us unbidden ſo to aſſiſt, is to think the Arke muſt fall, if we hold not forth our hands to hold it up, and takes from it the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſubſiſting by the way, by which it took roote, when (to borrow Saint <hi>Chyſoſtomes</hi> words) <gap reason="foreign">

All which reaſons make me beleeve, that there is much difference between the ſtriving to deſtroy theſe two ſorts of men, and if there were not, yet for fore-touched reaſons, and others which I will touch at, I ſhould as ſoone think it unlawfull to put Malefactors to death, as lawfully to kill Hereticks. For indeed ſince <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:165888:139"/>
               <p>Firſt, You put reaſonable ſcruples into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering mens minds, leaſt as a <hi>Greek</hi> Orator ſaith againſt <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> for ſtriking <hi>Therſites,</hi>

               <p>Secondly, It deſtroies thoſe plauſible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo often uſed of Unity, and Tradition, and Multitude, for, firſt Uniformitie may be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by power, but Unitie and Impunitie can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be parted; all other agreement being but as a theefe and a robbed perſon agreed, the one to take his purſe, and the other to give it againe.

               <p>To conclude, I ſhould be better contented with this courſe, if the opinions were infallibly errors, and infallibly damnable, and this were alwaies an effectuall way, (and no other could be found more mercifull) to ſtop their ſpreading, but ſince you have no infallible way of knowing the Church to be infallible in her definitions, and conſequently, that the contrary opinions are falſe, ſince you know not infallibly which is ſhe, (for you pretend but prudentiall Motives) ſince your knowledge having defined, is likewiſe fallible, as depending upon many uncertaine circumſtances, ſince; not onely the matter of Hereſie is thus uncertaine, but the form too: for you confeſſe you doubt whether <hi>Ignorantia affectata</hi> be it or no, and ſince though the form were certaine, yet in whom, it is by no meanes plaine, but rather impoſſible to be known, (as who is obſtinate, and conſequently to whom it is damnable) ſince this courſe often gives growth, and ſtrength to that, from which it would take even Being and Subſiſtance: I cannot but think you have cauſe to change your proceedings, leaſt not onely you expell not, but leaſt you encreaſe Hereſie, and againe leaſt you oppoſe it not, but miſtake the Truth for it, and applaud your ſelf for cutting off a Gangren'd member, when you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a ſound one, and inſtead of ending a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:165888:141"/>make a Martyr, and againe leaſt (allowing this to be the Truth) yet you put to death inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſons inſtead of guilty; eſpecially ſince if the opinions were damnable in whomſoever they were, yet ſome better way might be found, (as cloſe impriſonment or the like) to keep them from harming with them, rather then (as you do by putting them to death, when elſe they might live to be converted) to damne them certainly, leaſt they may poſſibly damne ſome others; Againe for Proteſtants, who joyne with me in beleeving that there is no way to know the true Church, but by true Doctrine, nor to know that but by the Scripture, (for Univerſall Tradition ſeemes to us to deliver nothing but what is ſo plainly contained there, that it is agreed upon) in them I beleeve it muſt be intollerable Pride, and raſhneſſe, (and the ſame in Papiſts concerning thoſe places out of which they would prove the Churches infallibility) To conclude, this ſeemes to me the ſence of this place of Scripture, therefore this infallibility it is, and no man can denie it, who either gainſaies not his Conſcience, or hath it not miſlead by ſome ſinfull paſſion or affection, and therefore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers muſt be damned, and therefore leaſt they damne others, we will ſend them through one fire to another. And this, though it be an equall fault in both Proteſtants and Papiſts to ſay and do, yet it is more Illogicall in the former, as contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at firſt ſight all their Principles, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the whole Platforme upon which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was built.</p>

And truely in my opinion ſome Queſtions among your ſelves are as great, not onely as any among your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, but as any between you and them. I but you anſwer, we have a way of being agreed, we reply, is it a way ſure to lead to Truth as well as to Unity, or elſe ſo might we have by going to moſt at three throwes, and reſolving to ſtand to that. Beſides, if you have, and make no more uſe of it, it ſeemes there is no ſuch need that Queſtions be ended, as for that purpoſe to introduce a neceſſitie of an Ender. But ſay you, neither are all ſuits in the Common-wealth ended; We reply, that yet truely thoſe Judges, who ſhould make no more haſt end them, then your Judge doth theſe, would deſerve to looſe his place, but this they
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:165888:142"/>do as faſt as the nature of the thing will permit; which being or depending upon matter of Fact, cannot be known enough to be judged before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of witneſſes, and the like, be ended, and if they willingly deferre the ending, they are confeſs'd to be in fault by all men, but thoſe who hold Perjury to be none.

               <p>Beſides if no grounds be ſufficient for Unitie, which produce not the effect, then it ſeemes, the grounds of your grounds, thoſe Arguments, by which you prove, that there is a Judge, and a generall Councell is it, are inſufficient, ſince they are not able to make all Chriſtians about this queſtion: Again, although a Judge, and this Judge be received, yet this is ſtill an inſufficient ground for Unitie, ſince the <hi>Greek</hi> Church agree thus farre with you (which is as farre as you agree with
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:165888:143"/>one another) and yet are not ſo bound by it to any univerſall Unitie with them, but that they eſteem you Hereticks, and are eſteemed ſo by you: and if you ſay, that it is not, becauſe the grounds, upon which the Infallibilitie of the Church are built, lead not ſufficientlie to Unitie, that we joyne not with you in beleeving them to be infallible, not becauſe the determination of generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels is not a ſufficient meanes of Unitie, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Church admitting their authoritie, admits not of your opinions, but it is the fault of us (and of them) hardening our hearts againſt the truth; then we may as well ſay, that ſome of thoſe, who agree in our grounds, yet diſagree from our doctrine, not that the grounds lead not to Unitie, but that our Adverſaries will not be lead; or if (as you doe, and ſome others of you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) you confeſſe, that they through an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent error diſſent from you, and doe this without any imputation in this reſpect to your grounds, I hope it will be lawfull for us to allow the ſame poſſipilitie, without any diſadvantage or prejudice to ours: Beſides, ſay you, though we agree to day, yet we may not to morrow, which to prove, were <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I anſwer, that, firſt, ſome of you, with whom I have ſpoken my ſelfe, hold, that the Churches authoritie in defining, extends no further then to ſuch points, whereof Tradition is of one part (as in many controverted there is, I beleeve, no ſuch) and that this rule ſhe may tranſgreſſe, and ſo erre.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, Neither the <hi>Dominicans</hi> nor their Adverſaries, are very readie to remain in ſuſpence to await her deciſion, but define all readie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her definitions, <hi>Cum utraque pars tenax con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendat ſuam non aliam poſſe definiri ſententiam,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part tenaciouſlie urging, that the contrarie opinion cannot be defined, which if they did to fright the Pope from defining, leaſt the condemned partie being even before, ſhould after make a Schiſme, they obtained their end.</p>

               <p>Firſt, I would know whether they be ſure to be at all times the Church, to that you refuſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rermine, and ſo incluſivelie denie.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, It is not poſſible, that ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhould ever give any ſentence explicitelie, nor can we ever know, that it hath even tacitelie done ſo, if they be to decree onelie by repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then how large a companie repreſents them with all their power, of whom that companie is to conſiſt, how many of them are to agree to make it a binding ſentence, &amp;c. are things yet unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and like to be, and if any goe about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine them, their power being it ſelfe ſtill a queſtion, could not end theſe: Therefore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you ſay, that we have no definitive ſentence
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:165888:144"/>(beſides that truly to have one, and not to know when we have one, is much alike;) I anſwer, that whenſoever the Scripture ſhall ſeeme to us to have defined, we are according to our doctrine readie to yeeld, and ſo the controverſie is ended (and ſure the Scripture may be ſaid to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive ſentence, as well as the written Councell of <hi>Trent</hi>) and till then, though we differ about interpretations of not plaine places, we have as much Unitie as you, who are not reſolved upon the ſence of manie decrees of that and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels: and if a deſire and diligence to finde the true meaning of them, and an aptneſſe to aſſent when it is found, be thought to ſecure among you, thoſe who miſtake the true ſence of theſe Councels, why ſhould not the ſame diſpoſition in us towards the Scripture, be thought every whit as ſufficient, not onely to keepe us in unitie, but to ſecure us from danger.</p>
               <p>To conclude, though unitie be a thing much ſpoken of by you, yet I finde it chieflie onely in your diſcourſe; your differences are many and great, onelie you ſay, you agree in what is neceſſarie, and make the meaſure of things neceſſarie what you agree in, ſo the ſumme is, you agree in what you doe agree (which it is impoſſible you ſhould not, though you had carried away the bayes from <hi>Bibrias</hi> his Tombe) eager againſt us, and yet divided among your ſelves, like the ſtate of an Armie in <hi>Tacitus, Manente Legionum auxilio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque, ubi adverſus Paganos certandum foret, conſenſu,</hi> and if your Church brag of ſuch an

For my part, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my ſelf not onely to be an Anti-Trinitarian, but a Turk, whenſoever more reaſon appeares to me for that, then for the Contrary, and ſo ſure would you be too; for the pretended infallibility of your Church could no longer hold you, if you thought you ſaw reaſon to beleeve it fallible, as you muſt do, if all weighed, more reaſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared of her adverſaries ſide, either your proofes of her authority not to be probable, or elſe your Doctrinestaught by her, more contrary to reaſon, then her authority (though probably founded, yet not upon demonſtrations) is ſufficient to caution, and anſwer for; It is true, ſo long as you ſtick to this hold upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, you are ſure to receive no error, but which ſhe offers you, (and indeed you need not, for thoſe are enough) but that deſtroied (which is apter to be deſtroied then moſt of the Proteſtants, as weaklier ſupported by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) then no error that a Proteſtant may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but ſo may you too, and the other is but ſuch a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:165888:146"/>Priviledge, as I may have by ſticking to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Church, as well as you to the <hi>Roman;</hi> And though this following your guide, may be able, as long as ſhe keep her ſelf, to keep you from ſome Ditches, into which you might otherwiſe fall, yet it may lead you unto others, and indeed there is no error but by this way you are liable too, yea, even of thoſe which ſhe now condemnes, ſince though ſhe changed her opinion, which is neither impoſſible, nor unlawfull, yet you are by your blind obedience to believe that ſhe had not, and to ſubmit your underſtanding in this Queſtion to ſome diſtinction, though without a difference. Theſe things then I diſlike in what you ſay.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Your ſaying, as though there is nothing to retain a Proteſtant from being of any error, when it ſhall appeare more probable to him then Truth, therefore there were nothing to keep him from thoſe errors, whereas you ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the greater probabilities may ſerve rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably to hold him without a demonſtration, and the evidence of the thing, without a guide, and that if thoſe be not ground enough for a man to fix upon, in how ill eſtate are thoſe of your Church, in the Queſtion concerning the Church, in which they follow no guide, nor have any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, but profeſſe they yeeld to her autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but upon prudentiall motives, which kind of arguments ſure may as well, and as fixedly preſerve a Proteſtant in an Orthodox opinion againſt a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, as the authoritie of the Church no ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier founded, can you againſt us: That every man
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:165888:146"/>ſhould yeeld to that diſcourſe which ſeemeth faireſt to him, I confeſſe, it is alwaies, not onelie ſafe and fit, but alſo neceſſarie, even for them who receive the Infallibilitie of the Church, ſince thoſe who beleeve that, beleeve it, becauſe that appeares faireſt to them, and as you object to us, the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of being perſwaded from the truth by ſome wittie Author, why thinke you not the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor may poſſiblie too, appeare to you to deſtroy your prudentiall Motives, and ſo conſequentlie your whole Faith, which is built upon the Church, which is built upon them.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, I diſlike your ſeeming to beleeve, that any grounds, which are not demonſtrative, are too ſlipperie to reſt upon, as not onelie being contrarie to reaſon, but to your ſelfe, who told me before, that no more was required, then a maine advantage on one ſide, and that we had reaſon to be ſatisfied with Probabilities to guide our Actions in Religion, or ſince by them we were content to regulate all the other Actions of our life.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, I diſlike in your own parties behalfe your ſaying, that a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is in good likelihood to turne <hi>Arrian</hi> (for if you meane onelie that it is poſſible, it concernes you as much as them) ſince this ſeemes to inferre, that the Scriptures doe make more probablie for them (which if they did, it is not Hereſie) and to contradict all thoſe, whom both parts call Fathers, who thinke enough plaine in Scripture, not onely to keepe, but alſo to convert men from <hi>Arrianiſme,</hi> as it appeares,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:165888:147"/>by their employing ſo ſolelie thoſe Armes againſt them, that they needed the admonition of a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique, to counſell them to the uſe of another.</p>
               <p>Fourthlie, I diſlike your ſaying, that after being made an <hi>Arrian,</hi> he is not unlikelie to turne <hi>Jew,</hi> eſpeciallie, that he is likelie to be perſwaded by any exaggeration of the Abſurdities in the Trinitie, ſince both <hi>Grotius</hi> and other Authors, ſeeme to ſay, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> have their Trinitie too in the ſame Notion, and howſoever the <hi>Arrian</hi> is ſo fullie perſwaded alreadie, that thoſe are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities (that perſwaſion being almoſt the forme of that opinion which conſtitutes him an <hi>Arrian</hi>) yet the exaggeration of them can never worke upon him; And for the Conſtellation you ſpeak of, it were ſo irrationall, and ſo unprovable a Crotchet, that no Oratorie could ever make it ſeeme to a reaſonable man, to have any inclination to ſence (and a foole may be made beleeve any thing, how contrarie ſoever to his grounds) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he be of thoſe, who are given over to vaine imaginations, becauſe they love darkneſſe better then the light, and the fault of no particular mens understanding or will, is to lead any man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne his grounds, for they are to be accuſed, not of whatſoever he concludes who holds (or rather in this caſe hath held) them, but onelie of what he concludes reaſonablie according to them. Beſides, for this cauſe it appeares ſtrange to me, that truſting to Scripture alone, and without, meaning the Church, for my certaine guide, ſhould bring a man into danger or parting with his Chriſtianitie,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:165888:147"/>ſince nothing can hold a man longer then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves it, and as long as our ground, the Scripture, is by him beleeved, no man can poſſiblie turne either <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> or <hi>Jew;</hi> and he who leaves to beleeve your ground, the Church, cannot by that be any more with-held from either: Beſides that, I thinke it is impoſſible (I am ſure it is irrationall) that any of you ſhould beleeve in Chriſt, upon the authoritie of Chriſts Church, ſince beleeving the latter (which claimes no authoritie but from Chriſt) praeſuppoſeth the beleife of him, and ſo Chriſtianitie is not the apter to be overthrown through the abſence of that, upon which it is not built: I feare rather, leaſt your doctrine known to be grounded it ſelfe upon Tradition by ſuch a way, according to which, a Jew would have much advantage of a Chriſtian, may incline a man to Judaiſme, and your ſides generall ſlighting all waies of knowing Gods will, but onely by the Church, and then neither proving her power ſtronglier, nor teaching how to know her plainer, may make men ſinke into <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> by being perſwaded by you, in letting goe other ſtrong holds upon Truth, and receiving ſuch weake ones from you. Not to ſpeake of your loading Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie with ſuch impoſſibilities as the Pillars of it, which are not abſolute Demonſtrations (of which it may be ſcarce any thing is in nature capable but lines and numbers) are able to beare, and uſing all your Wits and Induſtries to perſwade men, that it is equallie unſafe to refuſe any part of your Religion, as to receive none; and ſo inſtead of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:165888:148"/>making theſe your beleefs admitted for the ſake of Chriſtianitie, cauſing Chriſtianitie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected becauſe of them.</p>

            <p>AFter much debate concerning the fitteſt expreſsion of my duty to your Lordſhip, whether I ought by ſilence, ſeek to ſuſpend your beleife of the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my ſelfe, I have made here, or by a clear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of it, aſſure you of what I may onely feare to preſent you with, as apprehenſive of a miſ-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted affection; I conclude, what was moſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to my firſt, and immediate duty to God, was moſt juſtifiable to my ſecond; and derivative to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Therefore I reſolved ſo ſoone, to give you this ingenious accompt of my ſelfe: The greateſt part of my life capable of diſtinction of Religions, hath been imployed in places, and converſant with perſons, oppoſite to the Faith I was bred in, therefore it had been ſtrange, if Naturall curioſity, without any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall provocation, had not invited to the deſire of looking with mine own eyes upon the foundation I ſtood upon, rather there holding faſt blindfold by my education, to agree to be carried away alwayes after it, inſenſible of all ſhocks I met to unfaſten me, and beſides, I was ſolicited with the reproaches Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:165888:160"/>preſſe upon Catholicks, that they blindly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve all the Impoſtures of the Church, without any illumination of the Judgements, this my thoughts injoyned, the cleareſt information of my ſelfe of the differences between us I could propoſe to my capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
            <p>So at my laſt journey into <hi>Italy,</hi> I did imploy all my leaſure to a more juſtifiable ſettlement of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife, as I then imagined, by a confirmation of my judgement, in what had been introduced by my birth and education. I began with this conſideration, that there were two ſorts of queſtions between the Catholicks and Proteſtants, the one of Right or Doctrine, the other of Fact or Story; As this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Luther</hi> were the firſt Erector of the Proteſtants Faith, whether it had a viſible appearance of Paſtors and Teachers before his time, I reſolved to begin my enquiry with the Queſtion of Fact, for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe they were ſo few, and ſo compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible by all capacities, and the controverſies of doctrine ſo intricate, and ſo many, as they required much time and learning for their diſquiſition, onely I found my ſelfe unprovided for both thoſe requiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for this undertaking, and for the deciſion of the other, I needed not much preſumption to beleeve my ſelfe a competent Judge, when it conſiſteth onely in the peruſall of authentique Teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I conſidered, that there was no one point of controverted doctrine whereon all the reſt depended, but that this one Queſtion of Fact was ſuch, as the diciſion of it determined all the reſt, for if
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:165888:160"/>
               <hi>Luther</hi> could be proved to be the Innovatour of the Proteſtants faith, it was neceſſary evicted, of not being the true ancient Apoſtolicall Religion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I began with this enquiry, which Proteſtants are bound to make to anſwer to this Objection, to find out an exiſtence of ſome Profeſſors of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Doctrines before <hi>Luthers</hi> time: for finding the Catholicks were not obliged to prove the Negative, it was my part, to prove to my ſelfe the Affirmative, that our Religion was no innovation by ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence before that, but in the peruſall of all the Stories or Records, Ecceſiaſticall, or Civill, as I could chooſe, I could finde no ancienter a diſſention from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church then <hi>Waldo, Wickliffe,</hi> or <hi>Huſſe,</hi> whoſe cauſe had relation to the now-profeſſed Proteſtancy, ſo as I found an intervall of about eight hundred yeares from the time, that all the Proteſtants confeſſe a Unity with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> down to thoſe perſons, without any apparent profeſsion of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Faith. To anſwer my ſelfe in this point, I read many of our Proteſtant Authors who treated of it, and I found moſt of them reply to this ſence, in which I cite here one of the moſt authentique, Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi> in his Controverſie <hi>2.3.</hi> pag. <hi>479.</hi> where they aske of us, where our Church was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore for ſo many Ages? We anſwer, that it was in ſecret ſolitude, that is to ſay, it was concealed, and lay hid from the ſight of men, and further, the ſame Doctor, <hi>Chap. 4.</hi> pag. <hi>502.</hi> our Church alwayes was; but you ſay it was not viſible, doth that prove that it was not? No, for it lay hid in a ſolitary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment; to this direct ſence, were all the anſwers
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:165888:161"/>that ever I could meet to this Objection; I repeat no more, theſe places being ſo poſitive to our point. This confeſsion of Inviſibilitie in our Church for ſo many ages did much perplex me, it ſeemed to me, even to offend Naturall reaſon, ſuch a derogation from Gods power or providence, as the ſufferance of ſo great an Ecclipſe of the light of this true Church, and ſuch a Church as this is deſcribed to be, ſeeming to me repugnant to the maine reaſon, why God hath a Church on Earth, which is to be conſerver of the Doctrine, Chriſts precepts, and to conveigh it from age to age, untill the end of the world. Therefore I applyed my ſtudy, to peruſe ſuch arguments as the Catholicks brought for the proofe of a continuall viſibility of the true Church down from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time in all Ages, and apparance of Doctors teaching and adminiſtring the Sacrament, in proofe of this I found they brought many proviſoes of the Scripture, but this text moſt literall, of the fourth of the <hi>Epheſians, Chriſt hath placed in his Church, Paſtors and Doctors, to the conſummation of the Saints, till we meet in the Unity of the Faith,</hi> and next the diſcourſe, upon which they inferre this neceſſary viſible ſucceſsion of the Church, ſeemed to me, to be a moſt rationall and convincing one, which is to this effect, Naturall Reaſon not being able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to a man a cauſe that might certainly bring him to a ſtate of ſupernaturall happineſſe, and that ſuch a cauſe being neceſſary to mankinde, which o herwiſe would totally faile of the end it was created for, there remained no other way, but that it muſt be propoſed unto us by one, whoſe authority we could not
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:165888:161"/>doubt of, and that in ſo plaine a manner, as the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt may be capable of it as well as the learned. This work was performed by our Saviour, from whoſe mouth all our Faith is originally derived, but this ſucceeding age not being able to receive it immediate from thence, it was neceſſary it ſhould be conveyed unto them that lived in it, by thoſe that did receive it from Chriſts own Mouth, and ſo from Age to Age untill the end of the world; and in what Age ſoever this thred of doctrine ſhould be broken, it muſt needs be acknowledged for the reaſon above mentioned, that the light, which ſhould convey makind through the darkneſſe of this world, was extinguiſhed, and mankind is left without a Guide to infallible ruine, which cannot ſtand with Gods providence and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> affirmes for his opinion, directly in his book <hi>de Util. Cred. Cap. 16.</hi> ſaying, <hi>If divine providence doe preſide over humane affaires, it is not to be doubted, but that there is ſome authoritie conſtituted by the ſame God, upon which going, as upon certaine ſteps, we are carried to God;</hi> nor can it be ſaid, he meant the Scriptures onely by theſe ſteps, ſince experience ſhewes us the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall alteration about the right ſence of ſeverall of the moſt important places of it, that what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained there, cannot be a competent rule to mankind, which conſiſteth more of ſimple then learned men; and beſides, the Scriptures muſt have been ſuppoſed to have been kept in ſome hands, whoſe authority muſt beget our acceptance of it, which being no other thing then the Church in all Ages, we have no more reaſon
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:165888:162"/>to beleeve, that it hath preſerved the Scriptures free from all corruption, then that it hath maintained it ſelfe in a continuall viſibility, which Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> concludeth to be a marke of the true Church, in theſe words, in his book <hi>Cont. Cecill. 104. The true Church hath this certaine ſigne, that it cannot be hid,</hi> therefore it muſt be known to all Nations; but that part of the Proteſtants is unknown to many, therefore canno be the true; no inference can be ſtronger then from hence, that the concealement of a Church diſproves the truth of it. Laſtly, not to inſiſt upon the allegation of the ſence of all the Fathers of the Church in every ſeverall Age, which ſeemed to me moſt cleare; that which in this cauſe weighed much with me, was the confeſsion and teſtimony of the approved Doctors themſelves of the Proteſtant Church, as <hi>Hooker</hi> in his Book of <hi>Eccleſ. Pol.</hi> pag. <hi>126. God alwaies had, and muſt have ſome viſible Church upon Earth:</hi> and Doctor <hi>Field,</hi> the firſt of <hi>Eccleſ. cap. 10. It cannot be, but thoſe that are the true Church muſt be known by the profeſſion of truth;</hi> and further, the ſame Doctor ſayes, <hi>How ſhould the Church be in the world, and nobody profeſſe openly the ſaving truth of God;</hi> and Doctor <hi>White</hi> in his defence of the Way, <hi>chap. 4. pag. 790. The providence of God hath left Monuments and Stories for the confirmation of our faith;</hi> and I confeſſe truly, that our Religion is falſe, if a continuall deſcent of it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be demonſtrated by theſe monuments down from Chriſts time; this appeareth unto me a direct ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:165888:162"/>of themſelves, to produce theſe apparent teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the publique profeſsion of their faith, as the Catholiques demand; but this I could never read, nor know of any that performed; for Doctor <hi>White</hi> himſelfe, for want of proofe of this, is faine to ſay in another place in his Way to the Church, pag. <hi>510. The Doctors of our faith, hath had a continuall ſucceſſion, though not viſible to the world,</hi> ſo that he flies from his undertaking of a conſpicuous demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the monuments of his faith, to an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſubterfuge, or a beleife without apparance; for he ſaith, in the ſame book in another place, pag. <hi>84. All the eternall government of the Church may faile, ſo as a locall and perſonall ſucceſſion of Paſtors may be interrupted;</hi> and pag. <hi>403. We doe not conteſt for an externall ſucceſſion, it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth that they ſucceed in the doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Faithfull, which in all ages did imbrace the ſame Faith;</hi> ſo as here he removeth abſolutely all externall proofe of ſucceſsion, which before he conſented to be guided by. I cannot ſay, I have verbally cited theſe Authors, becauſe I have tranſlated theſe places, though the Originall be in Engliſh, yet I am ſure, their ſence is no way injured; and I have choſen to alledge Doctor <hi>Whites</hi> authority, becauſe he is an Orthodox Profeſſor of the Proteſtant Church; the reflection of the ſtate of this queſtion, where I found the Proteſtants defend themſelves, onely by flying out of ſight, by confeſsing a long inviſibility in their Church in apparance of Paſtors and Doctors; the ſame interpretation left me much looſened from the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:165888:163"/>faſtneſſe of my profeſſed Religion, but had not yet tranſported me to the Catholique Church, for I had an opinion, that our Divines might yet fill up this vacancy with ſome more ſubſtantiall then I could meet with, ſo I came back into <hi>England,</hi> with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſeeking nothing ſo intentively as this ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and to this purpoſe I did covertly (under another mans name) ſend this my ſcruple to one, whoſe learning and ſufficiency I had much affiance in, in theſe termes, whether there was no viſible ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion to be proved in the Proteſtant Church, ſince the Apoſtles time down to <hi>Luther,</hi> and what was to be anſwered to that Objection, beſides the Confeſsion of inviſibility for ſo many ages, to this I could get no other anſwer, but that the point had been largely and learnedly handled by Doctor <hi>White,</hi> and many other of our Church: upon this I reſolved to informe my ſelfe in ſome other points, which ſeemed to me unwarrantable and ſuſpitious in the Ceremonies of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, ſince I had ſuch an inducement as ſo little ſatisfaction in a point that ſeemed to me ſo eſſentiall; and in all theſe ſcruples, I found mine own miſtake in the beleife of the Tenents of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, gave me the onely occaſion of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, not the practiſe of their doctrines, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme me in the ſatisfaction of all them, I found the practiſe and authority of moſt of the ancient Fathers, and in the Proteſtant refutations of theſe doctrines, the recuſations of their authorities, as men that might erre, ſo that the queſtion ſeemed then to me, whether I would rather hazard the erring with them, then
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:165888:163"/>with the latter Reformers, which conſequently might erre alſo in diſſenting from them: I will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to diſpute the ſeverall Tenents controverted, nor doubt that your Lordſhip will ſuſpect, that I omitted any ſatisfaction in any of them, ſince my reſolution, of reconciling my ſelfe to the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, is not liable to any ſuſpition of too forward or precipitate reſignation of my ſelfe, my judgement perchance may be cenſured of ſeducement, my affection cannot be of corruption.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe reaſons I did, ſoone after my returne laſt into <hi>England,</hi> reconcile my ſelfe to the <hi>Romane</hi> Catholique Church, in the beleife and convincement of it, to be the true ancient and Apoſtolic all by her externall markes, and her internall objects of faith and doctrine; and in her I reſolve to live and dye, as the beſt way to Salvation: When I was in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> I did not ſtudy diſsimulation ſo dexterouſly, as if my fortune had read it to me, nor doe I now profeſſe it ſo deſperately, as if it were my fortunes Legacie, for I doe not beleeve it ſo dangerous, but it may recover, for I know the Kings wiſedome is rightly informed, that the Catholique Faith doth not tend to the alienation of the Subject, it rather ſuper-infuſeth a Reverence and Obedience to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, and ſtrengthens the bands of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to our Natural Prince, and his Grace and Goodneſſe ſhall never finde other occaſion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertion of them from the naturall uſuall exerciſe of themſelves, upon thoſe that have the honour to have beene bred with approbation of fidelity in

            <p>Secondly, He ſaith, that there being two ſorts of Queſtions, the one of Right, or Doctrine, the other of Fact, or Story; As whether the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Faith had a viſible appearance before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> he reſolved to begin his enquiry with the matter of Fact, as being ſooner to be found, (becauſe but one) and eaſier to be comprehended: To this I anſwer, by ſaying, that if they would not appeale from the Right Tribunall, or rather Rule, which is the Scripture, thoſe many might eaſier be ended then this one, (we building our Faith onely upon plaine places, and all reaſonable men, being ſufficient of what is plain) but if they appeal to a conſent of Fathers, and Councells, whereof many are loſt, many not loſt not to be gotten, many uncertaine whether Fathers or no Fathers, and theſe, which we have, and know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too many for almoſt any induſtrie to read over, and abſolutely for any memory to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, (which yet is neceſſarie, becauſe any one clauſe of any one Father, deſtroies a conſent) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:165888:165"/>beſides liable to all the exceptions which can be brought againſt the Scriptures, being the Rule, as difficulty, want of an infallible Interpreter, and ſuch like, and being denied to have any infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (eſpecially when they ſpeak not as witneſſes, which a conſent of them never doth againſt us) by one partie, which the Scripture is allowed to have by both, then I wonder not if he think ſuch a way ſo uncertaine, and ſo long, that he was willing to chuſe any ſhorter cut, rather then travell it: Neither do I beleeve this other to be ſo ſhort, or ſo concluding as he imagines, for if he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the large extent of Chriſtian Religion, ſo that we know little from any indifferent Relator of the opinions of the <hi>Abiſsins,</hi> ſo great a part of Chriſtendome, if he conſider the great induſtry of his Church in extinguiſhing thoſe whom they have called Hereticks, and alſo their Books, ſo that we know ſcarce any thing of them, but from themſelves, (who are too partiall to make good Hiſtorians) if the conſider how carefully they ſtop mens mouthes, (even thoſe of their own) with their <hi>Indices expurgatorii,</hi> it will then appear to him both a long work to ſeek, and a hard one to find, whether any thought like <hi>Luther</hi> in all Ages, and that he concludes very raſhly, who reſolves that there was none, becauſe he cannot find any, ſince they might have been viſible in their times, and yet not ſo to us, (for men are not the leſſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible when they are ſo, for not being after remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered) as a man may be a Gentleman, though he know not his pedigree: So that as I will not
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:165888:166"/>affirm that there were alwaies ſuch, becauſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove it, ſo neither ought they to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſure there were none, without they could prove that which is impoſſible, and therefore no Argument can be drawn from thence; and if it could be proved, that ſuch a no-waies-erring Church muſt at all times be, I had rather beleeve that there were ſtill ſuch, though we know them not, which may be true, then that theirs is it, which in may opinion cannot.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He ſaies that he could find no one point of controverted Doctrine, whereupon all the reſt depended, but that this one Queſtion of Fact was ſuch, as the deciſion of it determined all the reſt.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That the Queſtion of the Infallibilitie of the Pope, at leaſt of thoſe who adhere to him, which they call the Church, is ſuch a one, as if determined, muſt determine all the reſt, and not onely to us, but to all men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this (though granted neceſſarie, and determined to his wiſh) would indeed conclude againſt us, but not for them, ſince the <hi>Greek</hi> Church would put in as good a Plea upon the Title of Viſibility, as that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and he would be to begin anew with them, when he had ended with us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He gives his reaſon, If <hi>Luther</hi> could be evicted to be the Innovator, his Religion is then evicted of not being the true ancient and and Apoſtolicall.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, by confeſſing the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; but he might be the Renovator, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:165888:166"/>the Innovator, and then no ſuch conſequence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He ſaies we are bound to find an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of ſome Profeſſors of the reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion before <hi>Luther,</hi> which requirie is bound up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſuppoſition of the neceſſitie of a continuall ſucceſſion of a viſible, and no-waies erronious Church.</p>
            <p>Now I will firſt examine the ſence of his tearms. By the firſt, I conceive by a place he cites out of Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> that he meanes viſible to all Nations, but I pray, hath his been alwaies ſo, I mean at leaſt (for many Centuries) to thoſe Nations, which <hi>Columbus</hi> hath not long ſince diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>By the ſecond tearm Church, I ſuppoſe he meanes a Company of Chriſtians holding neither more, or leſſe then Chriſt taught, (for in a more large ſence, no man denies the Church to have been alwaies in ſome degrees viſible) and in this ſence, I not onely deny it neceſſarie, that it ſhould be alwaies viſible, but that it ſhould alwaies be, for I doubt whether there be, or for a long while, have been any ſuch.</p>
            <p>Next, That ſuch a one he meanes, appeares, becauſe when Catalogues have been brought of ſome, who in all Ages have differed from them in things which we hold, his ſide would not accept of them, becauſe they agreed not with us in all things, and yet when <hi>Campian</hi> intends to prove all the Fathers to be his, he uſeth onely this courſe of inſtancing, in ſome things wherein they agree
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:165888:167"/>with him, (though ſometimes not ſo much, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary ought to be inferred, as in the inſtance of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> for comparing his words with the Hiſtorie, it will appear, that he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him a Papiſt for not being perſwaded by the Pope) though they differed from them in many other, as indeed all the notable Fathers did in more then one point. I will therefore ſay, that if this be required to ſhewing that a Church hath been ever viſible, it is, more then either part can do, and therefore I hope they will come upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſideration to confeſſe that not neceſſarie for us to do, which is impoſſible for themſelves. For let any man look into Antiquitie, I will not ſay without all prejudice, but without an abſolute Reſolution of ſeeing nothing in it that contradicts his preſent beleefe, and if he find not ſome opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as unknown unto An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, as either he, or I; as the Popes Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces having power to deliver out of Purgatorie, confeſt by Biſhop <hi>Fiſher,</hi> and <hi>Alphonſus de Caſtro,</hi> where they treat of Indulgences, if he find not others at firſt unknown, after known, but not held <hi>de fide,</hi> which are ſo at <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Prayer to Saints,</hi> their enjoying <hi>the Beatificall Viſion before the day of Judgement,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tom. <hi>9.</hi> An. <hi>726.</hi> de fide &amp; Simbol.</note> 
               <hi>the Aſſumpti of the Bleſſed Virgin, and herbeing free from all actuall ſin,</hi> if he find not ſome wholly unknown, and abſolutely condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which we condemne, as the lawfullneſſe of Picturing God the Father, whereof the firſt is confeſt by <hi>Barronius</hi> in the Margent to an Epiſtle of a Pope,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2</hi> Lib. C. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> which ſaies the ſame, and the latter to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:165888:167"/>be found in many places of Saint <hi>Auſtine, Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and others, nay if he find not that all the Doctors, Saints, Martyrs of the two firſt Ages (I mean as many as are now extant, and ſpeak of it) held ſomething, which both parts condemne, as the opinions of the <hi>Chiliaſts;</hi> If I ſay, he find not this, or I ſhew him not that he might have found, it I profeſſe I will be ready to ſpend my life for that Church, againſt which I now employ my Pen: So that this will be the end, neither of your Churches have been alwaies viſible, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the difference is this, that we are moſt troubled to ſhew our church in the Latter, and more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Ages, and they theirs in the firſt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that we can leaſt find ours at night, and they theirs at Noone. And whereas he expects that Doctor <hi>White</hi> ſhould ſtand to this, to confeſſe his Religion falſe, if a continuall deſcent of it cannot be demonſtrated, if he himſelf will pleaſe to grant as much as he exacts, if he but continue in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and in this ſearch, I doubt no more but that he will ſoone leave to be a Papiſt, then I ſhould doubt if I ſaw him now receiving the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Kings Chappell, that he had done it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, His Reaſons for the neceſſitie of the Viſibility follow, becauſe the contrary were a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation from Gods Power or Providence.</p>
            <p>I anſer, To ſay he could not keep the Truth exactly in mens beleefe, were to derogate from Gods Power, to ſay he had not given ſufficient meanes to find the Truth, and yet damned men
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:165888:168"/>for error, the firſt would be a derogation from his Providence, the ſecond from his Juſtice, but to ſay he ſuffers men to erre, who neglect the meanes of not erring, and that he damnes none for a meer error, in which the will hath no part, and conſequently the man no fault, derogates from none of the three, but ſaies he, this is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the maine reaſon why God hath a Church upon Earth, to be the conſerver of the Doctrine of Chriſt, and to conveigh it from Age to Age.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, To conſerve it is every mans duty, but ſuch as they may all faile in, and indeed is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the the form of the Church, then the end of the Church, an exact conſervation making an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Church, and a leſſe perfect conſerving, a leſſe perfect Church. As for conveighance of Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, the whole Church conveighs none, whereof many (if his be it) have had but little conveighed to them. Particular Chriſtians (eſpecially Paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors) teach others, which it is every mans duty to do when he meets with them who want inſtruction, which he can give, and they are likely to receive, yet is not the inſtruction of others every mans maine end.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> I know perſwades him, that ſome body of men are appointed to conveigh this Doctrine which men are to receive, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deliver it, and this I abſolutely deny, for we receive no Doctrine from the Church upon the Churches authority, becauſe we know her not to be the Church, till we have examined
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:165888:168"/>her Doctrine, and ſo rather receive her for it, then it for her. Neither for the conveighance of the Truth, is it neceſſarie that any company of men in all times hold it all, becauſe ſome may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh ſome Truthes, and others another, out of which, by comparing their Doctrine with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, men may draw forth a whole and perfect body of Truth, and though they deliver few other Truthes, yet in delivering Scripture (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all neceſſarie Truth is conteined) they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all, and by that Rule, whoſoever regulates his life and Doctrine, I am confident, that though he may miſtake Error for Truth in the way, he ſhall nerve miſtake Hell for Heaven in the end.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, His next reaſon is their common <hi>Achilles,</hi> the fourth of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> which he chuſeth onely to employ like his <hi>Triarios,</hi> his main Battle, leaving his <hi>Velites,</hi> his light-armed Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, ſome places too allegoricall, even in his own opinion to ſtand examination.</p>
            <p>The words are theſe, <hi>He hath given ſome Prophets, ſome Apoſtles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 11.12 13</note> 
               <hi>ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors, and ſome Doctors. For the inſtauration of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the Edification of the body of Chriſt, till we all meet in the Unity of Faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, and unto the meaſure of the Age of the fullneſſe of Chriſt. That we may be no more Children, toſt and carried about with every wind of Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now out of this place I ſee not how a Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be evinced, rather I think it may, if that
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:165888:169"/>Apoſtle meant none.</p>
            <p>For firſt, He ſaith not I will give, but he hath given, and who could ſuppoſe that the Apoſtles could ſay, that Chriſt had given, then the preſent Pope and the Doctors who now adhere to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Allow that by what he hath given, were meant he hath promiſed, (which would be a gloſſe not much unlike to that which one of the moſt wittie, and moſt eloquent of our Modern Divines, Doctor <hi>Donne,</hi> notes of <hi>Statuimus</hi> (i) <hi>abrogamus</hi>) yet ſince theſe ſeverall Nounes are governed by the ſame Verb, and no diſtinction put, it would prove as well a neceſſitie of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Succeſſion of Apoſtles, Prophets, and Evangeliſts, as of Paſtors, and Doctors, which is more then either they can ſhew, or pretend they can, ſo that it ſeemes to me to follow, that theſe were then given to do this till then, and not a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of them promiſed, till then to do this, and ſo we receiving and retaining the Scriptures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in what they taught is contained, (as we would any thing elſe that had as generall and ancient a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if there were any ſuch) need no more, for if he ſay that men are toſt for all the Scripture, I anſwer, ſo are they for all their Doctors, nay, if theſe keep any from being toſt, it is the Scripture which does it, upon which their authoritie is by them founded upon their own Interpretation and Reaſon, who yet will not give us leave to build any thing upon ours out of plainer places, and though they tell us, that we cannot know the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures but from the Church, they are yet faine
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:165888:169"/>(as appeares) to prove the authoritie of the Church out of Scripture, which makes me ask them in the words of their own <hi>Campian,</hi> and with much more cauſe <hi>Nihilne pudet Labyrinthi?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighthly, There followes another reaſon to this ſence, that reaſon not being able to ſhew man a way to eternall happineſſe, and without ſuch a one man would faile of the end to which he was ordained, it muſt be propoſed by an infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in ſo plaine a manner, as even the ſimple might be capable of it, which being performed by our Saviour, it muſt be conveighed to ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages by thoſe, who heard it from him, and whenſoever this thread failed, mankind was left without a Guide to inevitable ruine.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That though all this granted, it proves not againſt us, for we have the Scripture come down to us, relating Chriſts Doctrine, and written by thoſe that heard it, which the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are capable of underſtanding, (I mean as much as is plaine, and more is not neceſſarie, ſince other Queſtions may as well be ſuffered without harme, as thoſe between the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans</hi> about Praedetermination, and between the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and allmoſt all the reſt about the Immaculate Conception) and thoſe who are not, neither are they capable out of Scripture to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the true Church, much leſſe by any of thoſe Notes which require much underſtanding and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as Conformity with the Ancients, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Ninethly, The ſame anſwer I give to this,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:165888:170"/>ſerves alſo to the following words of Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> for whereas Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> concludeth, that he could not meane the Scriptures as a competent Rule to mankind, which conſiſteth moſt of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Perſons, becauſe there hath been continuall alterations about the ſence of important places.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That I may as well conclude by the ſame Logick, that neither is the Church a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Guide, becauſe in all Ages there have alſo been diſputes, not onely about her authority, but even which was ſhe, and to whatſoever reaſon he imputes this, to the ſame may we the other, as to Negligence, Pride, Praejudication, and the like, and if he pleaſe to ſearch, I verily beleeve he will find, that the Scriptures are both eaſier to be known then the Church, and that it is as eaſie to know what theſe teach, as when that hath defined; ſince they hold no decrees of hers binding <hi>de Fide,</hi> without a confirmation of the Popes, who cannot never be known infalliblly to be a Pope, becauſe a ſecret <hi>Simony</hi> makes him none; no not to be a Chriſtian, becauſe want of due intention in the Baptizer makes him none, whereof the latter is alwaies poſſible, and the firſt in ſome ages likely; and in hard Queſtions a readineſſe to yeeld when they ſhall be explained, me thinks ſhould ſerve as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as a readineſſe to aſſent to the decrees of the Church, when thoſe ſhall be pronounced.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, He ſaith that the Scripture muſt be kept ſafe in ſome hands, whoſe authority muſt beget our acceptance of it, which being no other then the church of all ages, we have no more reaſon to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:165888:170"/>beleeve that it hath preſerved that free from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, then it ſelf in a continuall viſibilitie.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That neither to giving authority to Scriptures, nor to the keeping of them, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a continuall viſibility of a no-waies erring body of Chriſtians; the Writers of them give them their authority among Chriſtians, nor can the Church move any other, and that they were the Writers, we receive from the generall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Teſtimony of the firſt Chriſtians, not from any following Church, who could know nothing of it but from them, (for for thoſe parts, which were then doubted of by ſuch as were not condemned for it by the reſt, why may not we remain in the ſame ſuſpence of them that they did) and for their being kept and conveighed, this was not done onely by their Church, but by others, as by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and their is no reaſon to ſay, that to the keeping and tranſmitting of records ſafely, it is required to underſtand them perfectly, ſince the old Teſtament was kept and tranſmitted by the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who yet were ſo capable of erring, that out of it they looked for a Temporall King, when it ſpoke of a Spirituall; and me thinks the Teſtimony is greater of a Church which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the Scripture, then of one which doth not, ſince no mans witneſſing is ſo ſoon to be taken, as when againſt himſelf, and ſo their Teſtimonie is more receiveable, which is given to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures by which themſelves are condemned. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the generall reverence which ever hath been given to theſe Books, and the continuall uſe of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:165888:171"/>them (together with ſeverall parties, having alwaies their eyes upon each other each deſirous to have ſomewhat to accuſe in their adverſaries) give us a greater certaintie, that theſe are the ſame wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings then we have, that any other ancient book is any other ancient Author, and we need not to have any erring Company preſerved to make us ſurer of it: Yet the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as infallible a Depoſitarie as ſhe is, hath ſuffered ſome variety to creep into the Coppies in ſome leſſe materiall things, nay, and ſome whole Books (as they themſelves ſay) to be loſt, and if they ſay, how then can that be rule whereof part is loſt? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, That wee are excuſed if we walk by all the Rule that we have, and that this maketh as much againſt Traditions being the Rule, ſince the Church hath not looked better to Gods unwritten Word, then to his written, and if ſhe pretend ſhe hath, let her tell us the cauſe why Antichriſts comming was deferred, which was a Tradition of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and which without impudence ſhe cannot pretend to have loſt? And if againe they ſay, God hath preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all neceſſary Tradition. I reply, ſo hath he all neceſſarie Scripture, for by not being preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it became to us not neceſſarie, ſince we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be bound to beleeve and follow that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find.</p>
            <p>But beſides, I beleeve that which was ever ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary is contained in what remaines, for <hi>Pappias</hi> ſaith of Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> that he writ all that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> preacht, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi>-doth, that <hi>Luke</hi> writ all
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:165888:171"/>that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preacht, nay, <hi>Vincentius Lirinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> though he would have the Scripture expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ancient Tradition, yet confeſſeth that all is there which is neceſſary, (and yet then there was no more Scripture then we now have) as indeed by ſuch a Tradition as he ſpeakes of, no more can be proved then is plainly there, and almoſt all Chriſtians conſent in; and truely I wonder, that they ſhould brag ſo much of that Author, ſince both in this and other things, he makes much againſt them, as eſpecially in not ſending men to the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church for a Guide, a much readier way, (if he had known it) then ſuch a long and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Rule, as he preſcribes, which indeed it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that almoſt any Queſtion ſhould be ended by.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, He brings Saint <hi>Auſtines</hi> authority to prove, that the true Church muſt be alwaies vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but if he underſtood Church in Mr <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagues</hi> ſence, I think he was deceived, neither is this impudent for me to ſay, ſince I have cauſe to think it but his particular opinion, by his ſaying (which Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> quoted) that before the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> the Queſtion of the Church had never been exactly diſputed of, and by this, being one of his maine grounds againſt them, and yet claiming no Tradition, but onely places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, moſt of them allegoricall, and if it were no more, I may better diſſent from it, then he from all the firſt Fathers, (for <hi>Dionyſius Arcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gita</hi> was not then hatcht) in the point of-the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſts,</hi> though ſome of them (<hi>Pappias</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi>)
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:165888:172"/>claimed a direct Tradition, and Chriſts owne words.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As uſeth this kind of libertie, ſo he profeſſeth it in his nineteenth Epiſtle, where he ſaith, that to Canonicall Scriptures he had learnt to give the reverence, as not to doubt of what they ſaid, becauſe they ſaid it, from all others he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected proofe from Scripture or Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> condemnes ſeverall opinions of his, and therefore ſhe ought not to find fault with them who imitate her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, He addes two reaſons more, <hi>The conſent of the Fathers of all ages, And the confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Firſt I anſwer, That I know not of any ſuch, and am the more unapt to beleeve it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> vouchſafes not to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor to quote any, which I gueſſe he would have done, but that he miſdoubted their ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Suppoſe that all the Fathers which ſpeake of this, did ſay ſo, yet if they ſay it but as private Doctors, and claime no Tradition, I know not why they ſhould weigh more then ſo many of the now learned, who having more helpes from Arts, and no fewer from Nature, are not worſe ſearchers into what is Truth, though leſſe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of being Witneſſes to what was Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They themſelves often profeſſe they expect not to be read as Judges, but as to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their and our Rule, the Cononicall Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
            <pb n="295" facs="tcp:165888:172"/>
            <p>Fourthly, Let him pleaſe to read about the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Conception <hi>Roſa Salmeron,</hi> and <hi>Wadding,</hi> and he will find me as ſubmiſſive to Antiquity, even whilſt I reject it, as thoſe of their own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for they to prefer new opinions before old, are faine to prefer new Doctors before old, and to confeſſe the latter more perſpicatious, and to differ from thoſe of former times, with as little ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as he would from <hi>Calvin,</hi> (whom <hi>Maldonat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">6 <hi>Cap. St.</hi> Johan.</note> on purpoſe to oppoſe, confeſſeth he chuſeth a new Interpretation, before that of all the Ancients, which no witneſſe but my eyes could have made me beleeve) nay, and produce other points where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Church hath decreed againſt the Fathers, to perſwade her to do ſo againe, althoug <hi>Campian</hi> with an eloquent brag, would perſwade us, that they are all as much for him, as <hi>Gregory</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth who was then Pope.</p>
            <p>To the Second I anſwer, That Infallibility is not by us denied to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with an intention of allowing it to particular Proteſtants, how wiſe and learned ſoever.</p>
            <p>Thirteenthly, He ſaies next, that he after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to inform himſelf in other points which ſeemed to him unwarrantable, and ſuperſtitious, and found onely his own miſtakes gave him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Scandall.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That I cannot well anſwer any thing, unleſſe he had ſpecified the points, but I can ſay that there are many, as picturing God the Father, (which is generally thought lawfull, and as generally practiſed) their offerings to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:165888:173"/>the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> (which onely differs from the Hereſie of the <hi>Colliridians,</hi> in that a Candle is not a Cake) their praying to Saints, and beleeving <hi>de ſide</hi> that they heare us, though no way made cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that they do ſo, and many more, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any miſtake of his might have given him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be ſtill ſcandalized: For whereas he ſaith that thoſe points were grounded upon the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ancient Fathers, which was refuſed as inſufficient by Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that none of theſe I name have any ground in the Ancienteſt, nay, the firſt is by them diſallowed, and if any other ſuperſtition of theirs have from them any ground, yet they who depart from ſo many of the Ancients in ſeverall opinions, cannot by any reaſon be excuſed for retaining any error, becauſe therein they conſent, nor have the Proteſtants cauſe to receive it from them as a ſufficient Apologie, neither hath he to follow the Fathers rather then Proteſtants, in a cauſe, in which not the Perſons, but the Reaſons, were to have been conſidered. For when Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> was by this way both brought into, and held in a ſtrange error, though he ſpeakes ſomething like Mr. <hi>Mountague, Patiaris me errare cum talibus,</hi> Suffer me to erre with ſuch men, yet he could not obtaine Saint <hi>Auſtines</hi> leave, who would not ſuffer him, but anſwered their Reaſons, and neglected their Authorities.</p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, He ſpeakes of his Religion ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-infuſing Loyalty, and if he had onely ſaid it deſtroied or weakned it not, I (who wiſh that
<pb facs="tcp:165888:173"/>no doubt of his alleagiance may once enter his mind, to whom we all owe it, but profeſſe my ſelf his humble Servant, and no waies his enemy, though his adverſarie) would then made no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, but ſince he ſpeakes as if Popery were the way to obedience, I cannot but ſay, that though no Tenet of their whole Church (which I know) make at all againſt it, yet their are prevailing opinions on that ſide, which are not fit to make good ſubjects, when their King and they are of different perſwaſions. For beſides that Cardinall <hi>D' Oſſat</hi> (an Author which Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> I know, hath read, becauſe whoſoeuer hath but conſidered State matters, muſt be as well skilled in him, as any Prieſt in his Breviary) tell us, that it is the <hi>Spaniards Maxime,</hi> That Faith is not to be kept amongſt Hereticks, and more, that the Pope intimated as much in a diſcourſe, intended to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the King of <hi>France</hi> to forſake the Queen of <hi>England;</hi> he ſaith moreover, ſpeaking in another place, ſpeaking about the <hi>Marquizat</hi> of <hi>Saluces,</hi> that they hold at <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Pope, to avoid a probable danger of the encreaſing of Hereſie, may take a Territory from the true Owner, and diſpoſe of it to another, and many alſo defend, that he hath power to depoſe an Hereticall Prince, and of Hereſie he makes himſelf the Judge; So that though I had rather my tongue ſhould cleave to the roofe of my mouth, then that I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that a Papiſt may be a good Subject, even to a King whom he accounts an Heretick, ſince I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeve, that I my ſelf know very many, very
<pb facs="tcp:165888:174"/>good: yet Popery is like to an ill aire, wherein though many keep their healthes, yet many are infected, (ſo that at moſt they are good Subjects but during the Popes pleaſure) and the reſt are in more danger, then if they were out of it.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I beleeve that what I have ſaid may at leaſt ſerve (if he will deſcend to conſider it) to more Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> to a further ſearch, and for <hi>Memorandums</hi> in it, which if it do, he will be ſoone able to give as much better Reaſons for my concluſion, (that ſuch a Viſible Church neither need, nor can be ſhewed) as his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is degrees above mine. I hope alſo by comparing the body of their beleefe, and the ground of their authority, the little that can be drawn out of the fourth of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> with the Miriads of contradiction in Tranſubſtantiation, he will come to ſee, that their Pillars are too weak to hold up any building, be it never ſo light, and their building is too heavie to be held up by any Pillars, be they never ſo ſtrong, and truſt he will return to us, whom he will find that the hath cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſely left, if he be (which I doubt not) ſo inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, as not to hold and opinion, becauſe he hath turned to it, nor to ſtay, onely becauſe he went.</p>
